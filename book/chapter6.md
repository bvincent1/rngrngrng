The world exploded into tiny little fragments.

It did that periodically, but on a random schedule. Hector couldn't predict it, but he always felt a bit less when it
reassembled itself around him. He watched as the pieces arranged themselves into tiny little shapes, and then the shapes
slowly formed into recognizable things. People, places, things, they all reversed their fractal expansions, returning
perfectly into place. If he squinted, he could almost see the pieces before they actually materialized. But that took a
lot of effort, and Hector felt exhausted. He felt thin and frail, but he knew he wasn't. It was this dream, this endless
dream that had him running across town, chasing things and people. And now he was in a room with the people he didn't
know, and they were wasting time talking about things he didn't care about. He had to make sure they did what he needed.
So that the dream could stop.

_What did I need again? I thought it was clear, but now I can't quite put my finger on it anymore._

Involuntarily, he winced. His brain was bringing up bad memories, bad feelings. Inwardly he shuddered at the
recollection, but outwardly he was fixed in place. He started this dream with some terrible feeling, but the feeling was
gone now, and so he could think again.

_All I need is to do is find it. Find the fix._

Hector didn't have to look around to feel these strangers arguing and talking amongst each other. He found he didn't
have to look at things anymore to feel them, but when he did look at them, he felt he could see everything about them in
one glance. It was like looking through a kaleidoscope, but each reflection was moving independently of the other. He
could see everything that ever happened, and lots of the stuff that could happen, all at once. It was exhausting him
each time he did it. He'd seen so much death, and soo much pain in too many people. With infinite time and space, can
infinite suffering. Not just the suffering of others, but his own suffering as well. He saw all his own mistakes, and
mistakes that he hadn't even made but thought of, played out in an endless stream of thought. It was all there for him
to suffer through.

"..wants us to find out" Hector spoke without realizing it.

The others turned to look at him, and Hector glimpsed their fractal halos that only he could see. The boy, now a man,
with his idyllic view of the past, the woman forcing her story to align to her need for success, and the other woman
searching for meaning in a world without one. He envied them all. His past was mired in failure, and he was suffocating
under it's weight.

"We should bring him along," the man said, O'Delt to his friends.

Hector watched as O'Delt was eaten alive by the monsters waiting for him. He screamed, and fought, but they pulled him
under. O'Delt was gone. Hector knew this path has fraught with danger, but he couldn't tell them how dangerous it was.
If they knew they were sure to fail. He'd seen that too. He needed them alive, there was a path through the horrors that
awaited them. A a narrow gap between the horrors they were destined to face. That was how they'd win, not by meeting it
head on, but by skirting around the edge. He had to keep them on the path.

He felt a pull. A pull from far away, tugging ever so slightly at his soul. He ignored it, trying to coral his
directionless, errant thoughts into something workable. His mind was constantly floating. He could feel different
thoughts intrude into his psyche. A constant, slow, pulsing on his mind. Mostly the thoughts were his own, but not. They
always seemed to be reacting differently, they existed differently. Parallel to him now, but along different paths and
vectors along some higher dimensionality. Sometimes they pushed into his consciousness and he felt his body, usually his
mouth, acting out of turn.

But there was an even bigger presence. He'd felt it at the blok. He'd tapped into it. The presence was a font of barely
restrained power. The surge had almost torn his consciousness from his body, but somehow he'd held on. Now he felt it
again. It was swimming nearby, some great and ancient force hovering just outside his reach. Hector could feel the
ripples it left in it's wake. From this distance, he bobbed only a little on the waves, but as he got closer, it'd get
worse. Hector dreaded having to approach the source of his discomfort, but he needed it. Old habits die hard and he
needed the release. It tugged at him, a familiar urge. A muted pull like in his old days, but still their.

Hector returned to the room, refocusing his thoughts to the present and current space. They were arguing about
something. Hector wanted to warn them, tell them that this was all pointless and that they should abandon this search
and join him on his

The world exploded into tiny little fragments. It did that periodically, but on a random schedule. Hector couldn't
predict it, but he always felt a bit less when it reassembled itself around him. He watched as the pieces arranged
themselves into tiny little shapes, and then the shapes slowly formed into recognizable things. People, places, things,
they all reversed their fractal expansions. If he squinted, he could almost see the pieces before they actually
materialized. But that took a lot of effort, and Hector felt exhausted. He felt thin and frail, but he knew he wasn't.
It was this dream, this end;ess dream that had him walking across town and jumping up some building. And now he was in a
room with people he didn't know talking about things he didn't care about. He had to make sure they did what he needed.

_What did I need again? That man seemed very clear, but now I can't quite put my finger on it anymore._ And suddenly he
winced mentally. His brain was bringing up bad memories, bad feelings. Inwardly he shuddered at the recollection. He
started this dream with some terrible feeling. But it was gone now. _All I need is to find it. Find the fix._

Hector didn't have to look around to feel these strangers arguing and talking amongst each other. He found he didn't
have to look at things anymore to feel them, but when he did look at them, he felt he could see everything about them in
one glance. It was like looking through a collidascope, but each reflection was moving independently of the other. He
could see everything that ever happened, and lots of the stuff that could happen, all at once. It was exhausting to him,
but he forced himself to look. He'd seen so much death, and soo much pain in too many people.

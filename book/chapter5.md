Del clutched his arm and kicked at the door again.

**Bang bang bang**

The loud metallic door rang out in the dark and poorly lit hall. Del could see a camera suspended in the bare metal
support beams strung across the ceiling, pointed at the door. He turned to face it square on, making sure that anyone
watching would see him plain and clear. He paused, suddenly unsure if he'd come to the right place. He wondered if maybe
he'd read the address wrong, or misunderstood the directions. He stood there, pensive. Del thought about phishing his
phone out and checking the message again, but made a conscious effort to remain still and hold his arm instead.

Just then he heard a scrapping sound come from the heavy door. He recognized the sound of metal on metal, and figured
someone was sliding the bolt open. He wasn't even sure who this would be, since all Rikki had sent him was an address.
Knowing her, this was probably some discount medic or aid assistant who'd charge him an arm and a leg for a quick patch.
He waited and watched as the door slowly opened, revealing a small framed woman in thick glasses. She was middle aged,
probably a bit older than him, but not by much. She had brown hair, and her skin was a shade or two darker than the
usual pale complexion most people here possessed. Her brow was furrowed and he saw real fear in her eyes.

"Rikki?" Del asked hoarsely.

"Yeah it's me, who the fuck else did you think.." she trailed off as her eyes ran up and down his miserable state.
"Never mind. Get in, now!" she barked at him, concern in her voice as her eyes fixated on his injured arm.

She pushed the door wider and ushered him inside, quickly slamming the door behind him, re-fixing the bolts and lock.
Del stood quietly and waited for her to direct him. He'd never been to her place, and was surprised by how spacious it
was. Tall evenly spaced shelves with mountains of parts and electronics littered the space, and he saw a bank of
monitors against the far wall. The ceiling had the same metal support frames as the hall, and he saw cabling strung
across some of them, leading further back towards a pile he didn't recognize. Rikki darted around him, and made for a
small table.

"Over here," she beckoned him, indicating the empty chair at the table.

"Nice place" Del said, unsure what else to say.

Del wasn't even sure what she was going to do. She walked past the table and started rooting through some boxes on a
nearby shelf. Del figured she was looking for an aid kit, so he gingerly went about pulling his coat off. He awkwardly
lifted his arm out of the stiff sleeve, and tried to avoid flexing it so as not to crack the fresh scab that had formed
on his way over. With his uninjured side, he laid his jacket on the table and went about inspecting his tattered shirt.

"Found it," he heard Rikki mutter.

He watched her turn towards him, holding a box of materials. The relief on her face was noticeable. He wasn't sure if
she could tell that the bleeding had stopped, or if she had almost given up hope on finding her aid stash. She waked
over towards the table and laid the box on it, then went to inspect his wound. He lowered his arm and let her pick at
the hole in his sleeve. He made to pull off his shirt when she stopped him and rummaged around in her box.

"Don't touch it, I've got some scissors here" she said.

"Wait, wait. Do not cut my shirt. I can just pull it off" Del protested, raising his hands to fend her off.

"Del. It already has a hole in it. A hole where you were shot" she exclaimed tiredly, the newly acquired scissors in her
hand hovering dangerously close to his arm.

"Yeah, but it's a small hole. No need to make a bigger one." He protested some more. "Come on, just let me do it."

"You fucking idiot!" she yelled. "I don't even know where you've been for the last few hours, and it's all you can do to
keep me from helping you."

Del pulled away from her, his temper rising. "First off Rikki, we've never actually met. I don't even know you, and I'm
just supposed to trust you because we've worked together?" Del asked, feeling the weight of the situation come down on
him. He stood up, and though he wasn't tall, he still loomed over her.

"I don't know anything about you, and you certainly don't know anything about me. Not that I woke up in an alley covered
in trash and bleeding, not that I'm pretty sure I have a concussion, and certainly not that I left the hard drive." Del
exasperated loudly. He was suddenly very tired and a bit woozy, but he willed himself to remain upright. "Rikki why are
you helping me? I have nothing you want."

Del stood there, and tried to focus on her. He felt very weak and suspected that he'd lost a bit too much blood on the
way over, or maybe while he'd been unconscious.

"I...", Rikki paused as if she'd only just realized they'd never met. "You're only part way right. I don't know who you
are, and you're right we've never officially met. Maybe I should introduce myself," and she extended her hand. "I'm
Rikki."

Del stood there, looking first at the proffered hand, then at the woman holding it out. He'd thought that maybe he was
the more awkward one, but now he knew it was her. Then it dawned on him.

"What do you mean I'm only partially correct? And what do you mean officially?" his brain was slow, but he knew he'd
heard that correctly, and had a suspicious feeling.

"Oh, I made some copies while you still had me connected." Rikki said, matter-of-factly. "It was only when it was taking
too long did I stop and ask you to get that drive."

She left him standing there, scissors forgotten on the table. She wandered over to the bank of monitors, and sat down at
a chair. Del was conflicted between following her and finishing his aid work. He paused, switching between Rikki at her
desk and the box of supplies at the table. _You have to relentlessly prioritize_ he recited in his head. He reached down
and pulled his shirt off one handed, doing his best to pull gently it down his injured arm. He could hear Rikki talking
in the background, but he ignored her, confident she was going over his head with technical jargon and explanations. He
carefully pulled his shirt past the wound on his arms and dropped the filthy thing onto the seat of the chair. With a
clear view he saw that he'd been clipped just under his arm. Nothing too bad, but he saw blood seeping out of the
cracked scab. He reached into the box and grabbed a strip of gauze and a bottle that looked roughly correct for storing
sterilizer. He unscrewed the bottle, and double checked his guess. The smell confirmed it before he finished reading the
label, and he lifted his arm and braced himself. He gritted his teeth and went to pour out the liquid onto his arm,
aiming to have it spill on the top, and drip down onto the wound. He tilted the bottle and clear liquid poured out,
followed by a searing burning feeling from the underside of his arm. He quickly put the bottle down and grabbed the roll
of gauze, applying one end to the burning wound, and winding it around his arm. After a few passes, he laid the roll
down and grabbed the scissors from where Rikki had left them. He'd over-poured a bit too much and a few bloody drops had
landed on the table. Del paused and mentally juggled wiping it up with his shirt or some of the gauze, when he heard a
gasp from the monitors.

"Oh my god" Rikki gasped.

He turned his head, scissors halfway to cutting the gauze from his arm. Rikki was looking right at him, her face
transitioning between several recognizable emotions, and her mouth slightly agape. The most prevalent emotion was aw,
which Del felt a bit embarrassed about. He was shirtless in her home, but he didn't consider himself particularly
attractive. He was muscular sure, but not in a bodybuilder sort of way, more of a lean athletic way. The moment only
lasted a second before Rikki's face screwed up in frustration.

"Did you do that on purpose?!" she barked at him.

Clearly not in any danger, he finished his minor medical procedure and tied up the gauze into a tight bandage on his
arm. The pressure helped ease the burning, and he did a test flex of his bicep to make sure he still had good motion. He
flinched as it flared a bit, but he could still move his arm, and he didn't see a giant spurt of blood well up through
the bandage. Grabbing his shirt, he turned to face her and stuck his arms through the filthy garment sleeves.

"Sorry, I was busy. Could you repeat that?" Del asked nicely.

"Wh... well," Rikki stammered. "I only have some of the files. But they're all encrypted, and I don't have the
password."

Del walked over to her desk, feeling smug and trying not to strut too much, but also distinctly aware that he probably
reeked.

"So it's a dead end then?" Del asked.

"Well... I can do some basic analysis, and maybe if I get lucky I can crack the encryption, but without the password, or
even any other info... yeah probably." She turned to face the screen. "Sorry Del. Looks like you got shot for nothing."

She seemed actually sad about that. Maybe she did care about him. They had worked together for a bit, but he'd never
actually met her face to face. They'd never even had a conversation about anything beyond work stuff. He did feel a
connection to her, but it was only surface level. He cared in as much as he could, and they had a good working
relationship, but that was where it ended. He knew almost nothing about her beyond her personality and her tendency to
crack jokes. Coming here, seeing her face to face, having her help him like this felt like it was crossing a line. He
realized she probably felt much worse about this whole thing than he did. He knew it wasn't her fault, and that shit
went sideways out in the desert all the time, but she clearly felt responsible. He was about to explain to her when he
heard a noise from the door.

**Bang**

Del looked at Rikki for some sort of hint. She looked at him, terrified, and then quickly turned to her desk and brought
up the camera feed. Del alternated between watching the door, and trying to find the window with the feed. After a few
seconds he figured out which window had the camera. He tapped Rikki on the should and put a single finger to his mouth
in a 'quiet' motion. He squinted at the window. It was fuzzy and slightly distorted. Rikki seemed distraught by the
feed, and was busy checking settings on the toolbar, and looking around for potential sources. Something told Del that
this image quality wasn't normal. He motioned her to make the window bigger, and she dragged it across several monitors.
He squinted and made out two figures outside their door. One was covered it some sort of poncho. It looked filthy, and
their clothes underneath looked equally distraught. The other, standing off a few steps, he recognized.

**Bang Bang**

Taping Rikki's shoulder again he whispered, "weapon", and made an open gesture with both his hands. She paused for what
felt like an eternity and then slid open a drawer Del hadn't noticed was there. Inside was a a mess but underneath some
loose papers Del recognized the hilt of an ancient looking pistol. Rikki pulled it out gingerly, pinching it between her
fingers. Del almost smirked at the wanton disgust on Rikki's face, but he ignored his impulse to mock her and instead he
carefully, and intentionally grabbed it by the grip and walked towards the door.

"I know you're in there!"

From this side of the door the yell was fairly muffled. _That's a good sign._ He carefully pulled the slide back on the
pistol and checked if it had a round chambered. The gentle sound of metal on metal told him this weapon had not been
maintained very well, but he didn't have a choice. He saw the chamber was empty, pulled the slide fully back, and slowly
let the action chamber a round with a satisfying click. He leaned against the wall on the hinger side of the door, and
tilted the gun towards the ground.

"What do you want?" Del half said - half yelled, trying to project his voice through the sturdy metal door. There was a
pause, then a reply.

"How about you let me in, and then we can talk?" the womans voice responded.

"Clearly you followed me, so why don't you just tell me whats going on?" Del responded, unsure where to lead this
conversation. He heard some muffled conversation from the other side, but he couldn't make out any of what they were
saying.

"... just hold up." then she spoke up, "I didn't follow you dipshit! I put a tracker in your jacket. Look," she paused,
frustrated, "you're in over head. I don't need to sugar coat it. Let me help you. We'll track down Kant, and I'll split
the payout with you."

_I don't have a lead though, and clearly you don't either._ Mulling it over, Del concluded it wasn't worth it.

"G-"

"THE ENCRYPTION KEY IS GALAHORNLIVES" a male voice yelled.

Del paused mid word. He turned to Rikki who had been following closely on the monitor. He waited as she typed and
clicked away, pouring all her focus into this new solution. Waiting. Waiting. Rikki gasped, and gave a thumbs up, not
even turning to look at him.

"Who's that with you?" Del asked.

"This is Hector. He can help us." The female voice responded.

"And what about you?"

There was a a pause.

"Andy"

Del stood there, trying to consider his options. He knew she was right. And even more, this guy had known the password
they'd needed. It was obvious he was ou of his league. He'd made so many mistakes, and risked Rikki, and himself in
countless stupid ways. He had no thing to go on, and if he had even a chance of breaking even he had to keep going. _The
only way out is through._

"I'm opening the door." Del finally spoke up.

He gave Rikki a look, but she was busy and didn't even notice. Del worked free the door bolts and took a firm grip on
the handle. Gun tilted down, he twisted and pulled the door open, careful to stand slightly behind the heavy metal in
case it hit the fan.

Light spilled out into the hall, and Del stopped, unsure how it it had gotten so dark out there. He opened the door a
bit further, and saw the man first. Del felt a shock in his spine, and he knew deep in his bones that something was
wrong with this man. The man's hood was torn and his eery grey skin caught the light spilling from inside. They locked
eyes for a split second and Del felt a pressing feeling on his head. It felt like the kind of headache you'd get from
looking through a warped lense. A sort of twisting and disorienting throbbing. The feeling washed away a split second
later, and Del pushed the door open the rest of the way.

The lighting had evened out somehow, and it wasn't dark in the hallway anymore. Del stood there, and did his best to
retain his composure in front of these strangers. _Must be the blood loss._

"I see you've got a gun now." Andy commented sourly.

She was wearing the same outfit he'd seen earlier, but without a face scarf. There was a satchel bag over her shoulder
now, and Del thought about searching it. Something about the look on her face made him ignore that thought.

"-this is the first step" Hector said.

"What??" Del asked.

"I don't know... but he's been useful so far" Andy responded with the same sour tone as she'd given him.

The man, stepped forwards, un-beckoned and lightly pushed Del aside. Del startled and went to bring up his gun, when
Andy spoke up defensively.

"He's harmless." and then in a friendlier tone, "Relax. We're on the same side now. Besides, we both know you can take
me in a fight."

That comment reminded Del how he probably couldn't take her, and she knew it. He looked down at the gun on her hip, and
decided it wasn't worth the effort to pretend anymore. He tucked the pistol away on his back, and fully pulled the door
open. Andy stepped in and he watched as she did a quick scan of the place. He watched her focus on Rikki for a second,
before stepping to the table. Del quickly shut the door behind her, and spent a few seconds bolting it shut. He debated
leaving one undone, but figured he should oblige Rikki and bolt it down all the way.

"This your work?" Andy gestured at the shelves and piles all over.

"No, it's mine." Rikki responded, still focused on reading the newly revealed files. "Don't touch anything. Del might
trust you, but I don't." She added, clearly trying to sound menacing, but failing somewhat.

"Del... Gotcha." Andy looked him up and down, and then went to his jacket, still crumpled on the chair at the table.

Del was about to object, when he saw her reach into the chest pocket and retrieve a small metal disk. He felt a flash of
anger, and then embarrassment as he instantly knew how they'd found him, and how truly careless he'd been.

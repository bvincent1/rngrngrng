Del clutched his arm and kicked at the door again.

**Bang bang bang**

The loud metallic door rang out in the dark and poorly lit hall. Del could see a camera suspended in the bare metal
support beams strung across the ceiling, pointed at the door. He turned to face it square on, making sure that anyone
watching would see him plain and clear. He paused, suddenly unsure if he'd come to the right place. He wondered if maybe
he'd read the address wrong, or misunderstood the directions. He stood there, pensive. Del thought about phishing his
phone out and checking the message again, but made a conscious effort to remain still and hold his arm instead.

Just then he heard a scrapping sound come from the heavy door. He recognized the sound of metal on metal, and figured
someone was sliding the bolt open. He wasn't even sure who this would be, since all Rikki had sent him was an address.
Knowing her, this was probably some discount medic or aid assistant who'd charge him an arm and a leg for a quick patch.
He waited and watched as the door slowly opened, revealing a small framed woman in thick glasses. She was middle aged,
probably a bit older than him, but not by much. She had brown hair, and her skin was a shade or two darker than the
usual pale complexion most people here possessed. Her brow was furrowed and he saw real fear in her eyes.

"Rikki?" Del asked hoarsely.

"Yeah it's me, who the fuck else did you think.." she trailed off as her eyes ran up and down his miserable state.
"Never mind. Get in, now!" she barked at him, concern in her voice as her eyes fixated on his injured arm.

She pushed the door wider and ushered him inside, and quickly slammed the door behind him. Del stood quietly and waited
for her to direct him. He'd never been to her place, and was surprised by how spacious it was. It was a tall and wide
warehouse space. Tall shelves with mountains of parts and electronics littered the space, and he saw a bank of monitors
against the far wall. The ceiling had the same metal support frames as the hall, and he saw cabling strung across some
of them, leading further back towards a pile he couldn't recognize. Rikki darted around him, and made for a small table.

"Over here," she beckoned him, indicating the empty chair at the table.

"Nice place" Del said, unsure what else to say. He wasn't even sure what she was going to do. She walked past the table
and started rooting through some boxes on a nearby shelf. Del figured she was looking for an aid kit, so he gingerly
went about pulling his coat off. He awkwardly lifted his arm out of the sleeve, and tried to avoid flexing it so as not
to crack the scab that had formed on his way over. With his uninjured side, he laid his jacket on the table and went
about inspecting his shirt.

"Found it," he heard Rikki mutter.

He watched her turn towards him, holding a box of materials. The relief on her face was noticeable. He wasn't sure if
she could tell that the bleeding had stopped, or if she had almost given up hope on finding her aid stash. She waked
over towards the table and laid the box on it, then went to inspect his wound. He lowered his arm and let her pick at
the hole in his sleeve. He made to pull off his shirt when she stopped him and rummaged around in her box.

"Don't touch it, I've got some scissors here" she said.

"Wait, wait. Do not cut my shirt. I can just pull it off" Del protested.

"Del. It already has a hole in it. A hole where you were shot" she exclaimed tiredly, the newly acquired scissors in her
hand hovering dangerously close to his arm.

"Yeah, but it's a small hole. No need to make a bigger one." He protested some more. "Come on, just let me do it."

"You stubborn moron. I don't even know where you've been for the last few hours, and it's all you can do to keep me from
helping you."

"Ding", he felt a vibration, and heard the chime simultaneously. He fished his phone out of his jacket pocket, and
pulled it up to his face to read the notification. It was a request for a call. He tapped the squirming icon, and put
the phone to his ear.

"Got your ears on?" A familiar voice asked.

"Always" Arthur responded. He had been waiting for something all week.

"Good, cause this just came in and it's good" The voice was chipper, and excited.

"You say that about all of them." he said, trying to keep any sound of desperation from his voice. He needed this, but
he didn't want to sound like he needed it. That was always bad, but with Rikki, it was worse. She liked working with
him, but she also knew she needed to make a profit as well. When he'd made the mistake of telling her about his
financials, she'd teased him for weeks afterwards. He'd almost given up working with her, but she'd relented. He still
didn't fully trust her though.

"And you still go through with them, so really shouldn't you just take my side?" Rikki responded.

He could picture her smiling at him with her mischievous grin. She loved being right. He hated giving her the win.
"What's the gig?" He said, trying to cut through any ribbing she'd give him.

"It's a simple info retrieval. In and out. No contact, direct delivery. It's practically a cake-walk." She replied,
clearly also intent on skipping their usual jabs.

"Send the address, I'll take a look" he said. While he wasn't strictly 'rushed' for money, it worried him that Rikki was
rushed. There could be a million reasons why, and if he asked she'd just lie to him anyways. So he did his best to
ignore this newest gut feeling, and get this over with.

"It's on the north side, so get moving" she chirped as pulled the phone away from his face. A second later he got the
address. He hung up, and tapped the text which was actually a link. Rikki was always nice that way. He saw the map
connect a line between him and the dot where the address was, studied the instructions that came with it, and then
pocketed his phone. He started walking towards the nearest rail station. He had already known where the station was, but
it helped to be patient sometimes and double check. He'd learned in the military that being first was not always the
greatest, but being first and being unprepared was always deadly. He wasn't more than a block away from a station, so he
made good time. He passed people on his left and right, and did his best to ignore all of them. Even though it was
night, there was always people moving from one place to another. He liked watching them, always wondering what reasons
people would have to be out and about if they weren't like him.

Arthur felt solemn about how things were. He was smart enough to recognize the cycles and to realize that they were on
the brink of another collapse, but he also felt like he was stuck. He didn' thave the means or the power to change
anything. He barely had the means to help himself let alone others. Any effort he put into something herioc like
changing the world wouls surely cost him dearly. He wanted to be a hero, but he couldn't bring himself to sacrifice to
do it.

His phone dinged again with an update from Rikki. 'Remeber, they just wanna know where the perp went. Don't get
involved, don't cause a scene'. As if he needed a reminder. He pocketed his phone and waited a few minutes for his stop.
He got out and ascended from the underground rail, to arrive fairly close to his intended target. It had started raining
on his way over, and small droplets pattered on the glass windows and concrete walls. He pulled up his collar and
started towards the address. He walked briskly and with purpose, trying to fend off anyone from trying him just by
attitude alone. Nowheres in the city was particularly safe, but Arthur found that attitude made up a big part of
seperating those whom did get into trouble and those whom did not. Despite the violence, weapons were fairly simple. Guns
were semi-common, but more often attackers would use blunt tools. Arthur himself carried an extendable rod, prefering
the low profile approach. Indeed int he military, he'd been well known as an expert scout. His natural sense of stealth,
combined with his almost perfect sense of direction had set him up for success. He'd have made a great scout had things
gone differently.

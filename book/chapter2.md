"Ding", he felt a vibration, and heard the chime simultaneously. He fished his phone out of his jacket pocket, and
pulled it up to his face to read the notification. It was a request for a call. He tapped the squirming icon, and put
the phone to his ear.

"Got your ears on?" A familiar voice asked.

"Always" Arthur responded. He had been waiting for something all week.

"Good, cause this just came in and it's good" The voice was chipper, and excited.

"You say that about all of them." he said, trying to keep any sound of desperation from his voice. He needed this, but
he didn't want to sound like he needed it. That was always bad, but with Rikki, it was worse. She liked working with
him, but she also knew she needed to make a profit as well. When he'd made the mistake of telling her about his
financials, she'd teased him for weeks afterwards. He'd almost given up working with her, but she'd relented. He still
didn't fully trust her though.

"And you still go through with them, so really shouldn't you just take my side?" Rikki responded.

He could picture her smiling at him with her mischievous grin. She loved being right. He hated giving her the win.
"What's the gig?" He said, trying to cut through any ribbing she'd give him.

"It's a simple info retrieval. In and out. No contact, direct delivery. It's practically a cake-walk." She replied,
clearly also intent on skipping their usual jabs.

"Send the address, I'll take a look" he said. While he wasn't strictly 'rushed' for money, it worried him that Rikki was
rushed. There could be a million reasons why, and if he asked she'd just lie to him anyways. So he did his best to
ignore this newest gut feeling, and get this over with.

"It's on the north side, so get moving" she chirped as pulled the phone away from his face. A second later he got the
address. He hung up, and tapped the link. Rikki was always nice that way. He watched as the app opened and the route
loaded onto the map. A line connected between him and the dot where the address was. He studied the map's directions,
then pocketed his phone, and started walking towards the nearest rail station. He had already known where the station
was, but it helped to be patient sometimes and double check. He wasn't more than a block away from a station, so he made
good time. People passed on his left and right, and did his best to ignore all of them, and they did the same to him.
Even though it was night, there was always people moving from one place to another. He liked watching them, he liked
imagining what reasons people would have to be out and about if they weren't like him. At the rail entrance he heard an
announcement for his train, and he stopped to listen. The prerecorded voice announced that the train would arrive
shortly. He stepped faster than he'd have liked to make it. Steps flew past, and corners blurred as he half walked, half
jogged to make it in time. He arrived at the **stand** and found he had a minute to spare. He was slightly out of
breath, and felt his blood pumping from the exertion. He tried to slow his breathing, and get his heartbeat back to a
relaxed speed. Slow was smooth, smooth was fast. Breathe.

Despite the late hour, the train was not empty. He had to walk towards the back to find a seat. Arthur sat heavily in a
window seat and turned to look out at the far side of the tunnel wall, blurring past him.

Arthur found he was feeling solemn about the state of things. He felt like he and everything around him was on the brink
of collapsing. Mostly he blamed the megacorps for their collective predicament. The 'corps were too busy and greedy to
notice that they were eroding the very soil they built on. Arthur saw the people pushed to the brink by policies and
monetizations resort to fighting everyone they could just to hold on. Some chose to fight the megacorps, but those
people soon found out that military contracts were a core investment, and by consequence those victims were promptly
squashed by overpowered military might. Other people, perhaps the marginally smarter ones, chose to fight each other.
Those ones made gangs, and did their best to carve out kingdoms of their own. Crime was rampant throughout the city, and
only the mega rich could afford the security necessary to avoid it. Everyone else was left to fend for themselves.

Even the weather felt hostile. Being next to ocean, the city had always been subjected to harsher rain and wind, but
lately more and more problems had cropped up. Buildings collapsing from eroded foundations and strong winds. Rain
acidity causing concrete to deteriorate faster than expected, **necessing** costly repairs.

His phone dinged again, breaking morose train of thought, and an update from Rikki popped onto the banner. 'Remember,
they just wanna know where the perp went. Don't get involved, don't cause a scene.'. As if he needed a reminder. He
pocketed his phone. A few minutes later, he got out, and ascended from the underground rail. It had started raining
slightly on his way over, and small droplets pattered on the glass windows and concrete walls just outside the station.
He pulled up his hood and collar, crossed the building threshold out into the street and started towards the address. He
walked briskly and with purpose, trying his best to project an attitude of 'don't fuck with me'. Arthur found that
attitude made up a big part of separating those whom did get into trouble and those whom did not. Despite the violence,
weapons were fairly simple. Guns were semi-common, but more often attackers would use blunt tools. Arthur himself
carried an extendable rod, preferring the low profile approach to violence. Before all this, he'd joined the military,
and to his surprise been appraised as an expert scout. His natural tendency for stealth, combined with his perfect sense
of direction had helped him get noticed early on in his training. He'd been destined for a role in the
**scouting_regiment** before things had gone sideways. Despite that, he'd always retained his skills, and as he got
closer to the block he slowed from a brisk walk into a quiet prowl. He approached the final corner, and stopped just
short. He patted his jacket pocket for the reassuring weight of the extendable baton. Once he felt it, he leaned out
from behind the corner to peer around the corner for the target building.

The street was flanked with rows of skinny midsize rises, each about 3 to 5 floors high. The street itself was bare
except for a few scraps of trash littering the steps of the various rises. There were no cars, and no people. The rain
had pushed everyone to leave for shelter. Thin gaps separated the buildings, that Arthur was certain concealed tired and
restless people, waiting for fairer weather, or helpless victims to pass. He checked the address again and confirmed
that the target lived on the 3rd floor of the middle building across from him. The room number meant that the target
lived on the end, but he couldn't tell which end that meant. He pulled out his phone and messaged Rikki "Which corner of
the building are they in?", and then pocketed his phone instead of waiting for a reply. He turned around and made for
the back of the building opposite his target.

He knew he didn't stand a chance of getting in the front, but he was counting on the element of surprise for this plan
he was quickly making up as he went along. Cutting through the alley he counted until he arrived at the rear of the
building opposite. He was looking to get onto the fire escape and make for the roof, but first he had to find something
to climb. Trash was haphazardly heaped against the walls, but none of it was stable enough to support his weight. He
looked around some more, and found a metal trash bin that looked passably stable. He carried it to under the ladder,
carefully flipped the bin upside down, and stood it underneath. Judging by the structural stability, he figured he'd
only get one chance at this. He carefully climbed onto the bin, taking care to place his boots near the edges were the
metal would be strongest. Once he was balanced he looked up and readied himself. He breathed in, then out, in, out. On
the next in, he tensed and pushed off with all his might. The bin buckled under the stress, and he felt one of feet slip
a bit, but it was enough. He reached out and his fingers made contact with the rusted rung. He hung on the rung while
the can clattered with a resounding bang. Turning slightly he swung his other hand up to make contact and strained his
muscles to pull himself up.

Arthur underestimated how much effort this was taking him. He pulled himself up, and remembered the endless exercises
and training he'd undergone. The screams and yells of instructors and fellow recruits flooded his memories as he muscled
up to the next bar. He made it up, and up, and before he knew it he was huffing on the metal grating of the first
landing. He took a moment to catch his breath as best he could, but he didn't want to stay longer in case that noise had
alerted someone looking to cause him trouble. He quickly ascended the grated metal steps, carefully testing his weight
in some of the more corroded sections. Before he knew it he was at the roof. It was painfully obvious he'd made it
because the rain and wind had picked up and were now battering him from what seemed like both sides.

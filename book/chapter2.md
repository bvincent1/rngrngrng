> UNII Corps log date 2327-09-29-1048

Hector's world slowly came back into focus. Consciousness leaked back into his body. It started in his hands and feet,
and slowly moved up into his arms, legs, and shoulders. Eventually it reached his head. It slowly self assessed and
confirmed he was alive and mostly intact. Hector slowly opened his eyes and squinted as the light seeped in. His vision
was blurry and filled with spots. While his world slowly came into focus, he guessed it was mid morning.

He'd curled up in a corner where a chain-link fence met a wall. The fencing had slats for privacy, but those had long
since degraded into mere suggestions. The other side was a corrugated metal wall that had rusted into a husk of it's
former glory. It had been a complete building at one point, but it had collapsed and the exposed metal beams now looked
like ribs on a carcass. Rust seeped out into his corner, and made the metaphor look even more convincing with it's dark
red and black stains on his clothes and the trash he'd slept on. The wind caused the metal to groan and whistle, as if
the building hadn't finished dying yet despite it's exposed organs and hemorrhaging blood. Between the rust, and
scavenging, Hector figured it didn't have long before it collapsed into itself and finally died. Hector slowly propped
up against the corrugated wall to try and see past the heaps, further into the yard. The yard was only marginally
better. The gravel had long since been turned to mud, and garbage was pilled everywhere. Hector has been upwind of most
of it, but the damp smell of rot, and rust was still present. His head started to ache and the groaning metal corpse he
was sitting against was only accelerating what was going to be a crippling withdrawal migraine. He slowly moved and
pushed off his makeshift cover of damp cardboard. He slowly rolled onto his back, and stretched his legs. He silently
thanked himself for passing out in a position that hadn't left him completely crippled with soreness.

He slowly pushed himself up into a sitting position against the wall. His grimy clothes helped him slide up the wall
rather than scrub it, and he sat upright for a minute. Slowly he tried to focus is spinning mind. The drugs always wore
off in stages but this stage had been more delayed. He rubbed his temple with one dirty hand and then massaged some
feeling back into his shoulder with the other. The pain slowly hit him as the drugs continued to wear off. He was coming
down from his latest high, and he knew it wouldn't be good. Propping himself up some more, ever so slowly, and with
careful movements he tried to see more of the yard. He didn't remember how he'd gotten in, but he was at the back, the
entrance probably out the far side. Hector could feel the weather was going to get worse soon, not that it was great
right now.

He never liked it in this place. It was always "almost" raining. Grey clouds, cold breezes, the wet rotting stink of
vegetables, fish and damp concrete was something that he never quite got used to. He never wanted to be here, and he
certainly didn't want to get used to it. He'd been trapped in this city by poverty and vices that he couldn't sustain.
His original plans had long gone to hell, and now he was just scrapping by hopping to get lucky someday and be able to
leave. This city had taken a lot from him, and he'd tried to fight it, but it leached into him, just like the rust and
damp that leached into everything else here.

_Crack_

The noise came from the front of the yard. Hector froze, suddenly wishing his cover of trash and mud was still on top of
him.

_Crack_

He heard it more clearly this time, and it sounded wet and painful. He knew that sound from witnessing it. You didn't
make it as far as he did without seeing some horrible things. He knew it wasn't anything he wanted to get involved in,
so he leaned forwards and made to crawl along the poorly maintained fence, hoping for a break in the links he could
crawl through.

_Crack_

He crawled perpendicular to the noise, as best he could manage. On hands and knees, he scuttled along the fence. He
could feel the hairs on the back of his neck starting to rise. He knew he was in danger from something that he didn't
want to be involved in.

_Crack_

He turned his head this time, hoping not to see anything between the heaps of trash, but figuring he'd at least see if
he'd been made yet. All he could see was trash, but he heard voices now.

"-ck was that!?", one deep male voice.

"'ell if I know". Then muffled noises. "did you see his skull! ... eyes", another man's voice yelled, sounding slightly
smaller than the other.

He was in the orange zone, as it was called. This was a place that had been all but abandoned by the city and was
considered barely habitable. Of course that meant that it was habited by people who barely counted. The city was divided
up into three zones, green, orange, and red.

Green was the newest zone, post war construction, and while it's residents where not exclusively well off, it was where
all the new efforts were made. He'd been up and down it's streets many times, but with more modernization came more eyes
and therefore more risks for those like Hector. Getting mobbed by some gang, beat by some corporate enforcers, or
scooped up by some unhealthy organization were all very real possibilities. They all knew that nobody would come looking
for someone who looked like he did. Someone covered in dirt and rags, someone who sculked alone with any friends. They
were the prey for anyone.

The orange zone was only marginally better off. In a place where everyone was up against the wall, at least you knew the
game. It was pre war, so most of the zone was in shambles, with a few buildings and structures that made notable
exceptions. This zone was ruled by gangs and warlords who needed bases to run their empires, and places like this were
great for the very same reasons Hector was here. Fewer eyes, more danger. Lower gangs set up shop in whatever they could
scavenger, which was always more than they could feasibly manage, and cut each other to bits a vain attempts to try and
maintain their overreaching greed.

_Crack_

"..id you see it! That bastard twitched again!!" the first voice yelled.

"... leave it alone. ... didn't 'ave any cash anyways. 'ucking waste o' time!" the second voice yelled back as he
started walking away.

"..creeps" said the second as he followed his companion.

Wait. Hector could hear the crunch, suck of their steps walking out the front of the yard. Wait. Nothing happened, and
he moved closer to the body. Having frozen, he slowly stood up. Every movement brought more protests from his sore and
spent muscles. His body protested like it had run a marathon while he was passed out, but he ignored it. Slowly he
scuttled towards where the crunching sound had been coming from. He only just noticed that chest was pounding, and it
only compounded his perception of the risks he was taking. But he had to look. Of course he knew what it was. Only one
thing made that kind of noise. Hector knew the person was dead, or very close to it. This freshly made corpse had
clearly gotten caught, and they were now paying the price.

He crept closer to the body, moving around some broken wood piles, to get a better look. It lying face up in the center
of a small clearing. A gurgling noise was coming from the heap of gore. The bubbling was wet, slow, and rhythmic.
Everything was a mess. Blood had pooled all around the body, and stained everything a deep red. The clothes seemed to be
more akin to robes, long and draped down the body, maybe white or tan, but they'd been stained dark grey and deep red by
the mud, blood, and gore. As he moved closer, he could make out the arms and legs, but 3 of them had been brutally
wrenched and now pointed in unnatural and wrong angles. Hector winced involuntarily as he saw bubbles rise from the
chest. It had been caved in, and slit across the belly. Organs Hector didn't recognize could be seen slopping inside
with each gurgle and bubble. How anyone could be alive, still, was beyond him. As he gawked in horror at the chest, his
eyes slowly moved up the corpse and tried to make sense of the head. The skull was gone. Actually it was a wet pile that
no lunger resembled a skull, but rather a rotten squash that had been smashed to bits. Brain matter was splashed around
the mud such that he couldn't tell where mud started and brain began. Hector could feel fear welling up in his chest, he
knew something was wrong. He'd always trusted his gut, and he always been better for it. Between the small bubbles
oozing from the rended chest, the smashed skull, and the bent limbs Hector almost didn't see it. His brain was slow from
the oncoming hangover, and he was still wrapped up in the why of this abhorrent war crime. Even by gang standards this
seemed excessive. This person had fucked up.

Standing there a few extra seconds, Hector realized why this gave him the chills. He slowly started backing away, body
reacting before his brain could catch up. The arms were too long, the chest was too small, and the skull, what was left,
almost angular. This body wasn't normal, wasn't fully human. Suddenly Hector could only see wrongness on it. He tripped
on some wooden debris and fell backwards on his ass. The bubbling seemed to reach into him. He felt ill all of a sudden.
He turned and started clambering on all four limbs towards the back, desperate to leave through some hidden break in the
fence. He couldn't explain his fear. Perhaps it was the wrongness of the body? Maybe it was just the hangover? Maybe he
was still high? Either way he had to leave. Now. His fingers were covered in lumpy mud and specks of garbage. His
clothes were still caked in it, and now every time he moved parts either fell off, or stuck anew. He winced at the
noises coming from him, horrified that he was making more noise than whatever else was in the yard. He did not feel
alone anymore. On all fours, he made it back to the fence. He stood up fully, for what felt like the first time in ages.
His body was stiff and sore from it's continued abuse. He followed the fence towards the opposite corner from where he
started, desperately looking for a gap to exploit. His heart was pounding and his head hurt anew. He couldn't explain
this reaction but he knew to trust it and get away from this place. He swore he could feel eyes on him. What was it that
the ganger had said about eyes? He Ignored the thought, and kept following the fence.

Just around some tall concrete and steel boxes he saw his escape. Some metal pipes had been stacked flat next to the
fence. Secured by vertical moorings they were lying length ways, and were stacked high enough that if he climbed on top,
he could jump off them, and over the fence. He stepped up to the pipe and tried putting his booted foot on the first
pipe. He immediately slipped off the pipe and loudly cracked his shin on it, only managing to stay upright by
reflexively grabbing the closest mooring post that was holding the pipes stacked. The sucked in a breath and quickly
tried again, this time using the mooring as support, and more carefully judging the slippage from the mud, slime, and
general decay of his boots. Several careful steps later and he was standing on the pipes, ready to jump over the fence
and be free of whatever horrors were here. He took one last look back, sure he'd see something standing over the body
looking at him. But nothing was there. He turned, and as fluidly as he could leapt over the fence.

He did land gracefully. The fence, while not razor tipped was still slightly higher than the stack of pipes, and so he
had to tuck his legs in the air. This meant that he landed in a heap on the other side. He caught himself on his hand
and knees in the gravel, rather than fully fall onto his stomach. He landed on a small gravel road that served as the
alley between yards. The gravel stung and clung to his hands and knees while he struggled to get up. Brushing it off, he
got to walking away as quickly as his groaning muscles would let him go. The comfort of his sanity was his highest
priority, so his muscles and their respective issues got pushed to the back of his mind as he limped away down the road,
opposite of where he started, and ever further from the wrongness.

He could feel his heart start to beat normally again, and his subconsciousness felt less threatened for his immediate
safety. Limping down the gravel road he quickly passed the next yard and turned away towards the opposite side. He now
felt the hangover thudding into his skull, and he knew he had to get home. He continued crossing the meager gravel alley
road and went to squeeze between two standing concrete buildings. He thought he was familiar with this industrial area,
but couldn't confirm it just yet. The problem with waking up was he always seemed to forget how he'd arrived. He'd
probably walked in through the front gate of that yard. Not an option anymore. Stalwart, he kept plodding forwards,
knowing he could figure out where he was on the other side of this alley. Half squeezing through, half shuffling, he
scrapped along one of the concrete walls towards a main road at the other end of this dark, half hearted tunnel.
Stepping over debris and muck, he pulled up the hood on his filthy weather jacket, and adjusted his pants' belt.
Attempting to look less meek and more capable, he stepped out of the damn darkness of the gap, and surveyed where he'd
ended up.

It's not like he was far away from where he started this morning, but he felt better about this direction. It was busier
here, and that itself made him feel reassured. About a block down the road he saw some people milling past the
buildings, and further down he could make out an intersection with some vehicles waiting to proceed. The road itself was
narrow and the buildings seemed to lean forwards past their foundations, further lending to the cramped feeling of this
industrial sector. Cabling running at uneven intervals between the buildings made it feel like a jungle of concrete,
plastic, and metal. Some lit-up signs advertised various businesses, but they were sparsely placed, hinting at the
slummy nature of this place. In the other direction, much of the same, though Hector could see some buildings had
actively collapsed and were spilling onto the sidewalk. He started towards his home, towards the intersection.

The orange zone was a collection of ruins, and shanty-growth that barely supported life. Buildings that were considered
dangerous and unusable sat scattered throughout, supported by haphazard construction and cannibalistic scavenging from
other ruins and abandoned shanty work. Most of the original buildings still had scars from the war that had scorched
this town from decades past. Explosions, bullets, and fighting had destroyed and crippled the southern bay of the city.
He didn't know the specifics of that war, because it had been over 60yrs ago. But no-one had come back after the war.
While the green zone had been built, the other zones had been left behind. Ugly scars on the city that nobody cared
about or wanted to deal with. It was far easier to build new where there was already nothing, than to venture out into a
desolated war zone to find something livable.

And it was still a war zone. People were still finding equipment, weapons, and munitions scattered throughout, and
people were still fighting over those scraps. That's were Hector made his living. He stole and scrapped old relics to
sell them to the gangs. It wasn't his first career choice, but he had proven decent at it. He was a thief, a dealer, and
a fighter when necessary. He didn't want to be in this city, and he was slowly running out of gangs to con. Even with
the constant turnover of warlords and gang leaders, he was still burning through his contacts faster than they replaced
each other. He was reaching the end. He hated the condition that it left him in day after day, but it was either
struggle or die and he didn't have it in him to die willingly. He knew he'd end going down hard, not in some accident.
In the meantime when he got low he turned to drugs, and lately he'd been low often. He'd been feeling low, but his luck
would change, he knew it. The next big score was out there. All he needed to do was find it.

He kept walking past the intersection, passing people arguing, waiting vehicles, and huddled crowds of failures -
probably liking themselves to him. He didn't look any of them in the eye, for fear of inviting some conversation, or
communion. He felt that he kept a better standard than these wretches, and unlike them, he actually had someplace dry to
sleep. Of course it was only mostly dry. Hector lived in the red zone. The abandoned part of the city. Past the seawall.
The red zone was not necesailiry un-livable, but it was unaccessible and actively in decline due to the fact that it was
actively being swallowed up by the sea. It was the oldest part of the city. From back before the weather turned sour,
and the water levels were lower. Hector had heard that this place was once nice to live in. People claimed it had been
prosperous and temperate. Nowadays the water and the wind dominated the landscape with its endless depth, and the biting
tear. If it wasn't the water sucking you under, the wind knocked you down. The weather had been the biggest decline of
the city. The wars had certainly helped, but at some point in the history of earth, we'd fought each other with such
ferocity that the weather had changed into an enemy. Now humanity was scrapping by and by all counts we were something
of a lost cause by Hector's count. It seemed that everyday we fought each other, and killed more of our own, only for
the earth to chip away even more. It was less about survival of the fittest, and more survival of the lucky. Get your's
and get out. That what he likened it to. Their was no solidarity left, just individuals fighting over each other to
carve out freedom.

Luck would shine on Hector soon. His gut told him so, and he always trusted his gut. Following the road and the soon the
smell of damp concrete, Hector made it to the sea wall. This wall wasn't something you could stand on, something to keep
the city in, but rather to keep the water out. A long time ago, the water level had risen, and the walls had been made
to keep out the water, and keep the city livable. The wall was 10 meters of faded concrete and steel built along some
ancient road as a bulwark against the literal encroaching tides. it had cracks in places, but repair was certainly
easier that creating a new one. On top of that, the main city couldn't survive without the constant flow in desperate
workers this place produced. Of course since it had been build part way through the city, there were still places to get
through the wall, you just had to know somebody. Hector followed the wall, towards the central city, until he reached a
place he was familiar with.

He'd made it to a square that was busy with people. This was a marketplace he was vaguely familiar with. With stalls
arranged in mostly straight rows, the smells of fish and offal ablated Hector's sense of smell. He almost gaged from the
combination of the smell and his throbbing migraine. It clung inside his nostrils and he felt his eyes water for a
second until he gathered his constitution and willed himself forwards. Following the road and the shabby buildings he
was met with some gangers at standing at the perimeter. It wasn't a shakedown, it was security. These stalls and vendors
all payed tithes of some sort to be here and it return they got security. Of course everyone had to barter for
themselves, so who knows what each paid to be here. Hector didn't care, he wasn't here to do business with them today.
Besides the fact that he was confident he'd previously done business for this outfit, he was only trying to find one of
the vendors in particular. He needed to re-up and he knew exactly who to scam to get it.

He tugged at the corner of his hood a little to try and disguise his identity just enough. Not that is was likely to
matter. These were all new recruits, obviously given the shit work of standing guard. None of them knew who he was, and
he had no intension of giving them any indication of how much he owed their bosses. He shuffled meekly past a woman with
a holstered pistol and a leather vest. She looked bored and detached from her mindless work. Normally someone covered in
filth like him would be a dead giveaway, but everyone here was down on their luck, so he just blended in with the rest
of the rabble. The market itself has shambles by most standards. Wooden slats holding up some tattered cloths with shop
names and descriptions, held above slanted tables to do business on. Some had steel pipes held together with rope,
other's were just people sitting on the ground, bags emptied out onto the floor. He wandered up and down the rows until
he saw what he was looking for. They were at the end of the row. Two people minding a cart that had an assortment of
junk on it. He didn't know either of them, but he knew their game. It was alarmingly simple. One would sell you while
the other picked your pockets. Simple, clean, and it anything went wrong, they'd call the guards and get you kicked out.
Of course the guards got their cut too, so everyone was in on it. He knew that was their game, because nobody went even
near their cart. All the locals knew the game, and stayed clear. These people were like him. Preying on newcomers to
keep their business thriving. Constantly on the prowl for new fish. He'd bite, but unlike them, he had nothing of value
on him, which was fine long as they didn't find out.

He'd done this before of course. Stolen from other thieves. He didn't really need to justify the ethics of it in a place
like this. Everyone was filthy and constantly trying to get one up on each other. But it helped him feel better knowing
that he was only leveling the playing field by taking from people who, probably out-right, took from everyone else. As
long as he wasn't the worst person at the deal, he felt justified. When the means of both parties were close, he just
tried not to think about it, and moved on quickly.

He pretended to inspect some food at a nearby stall, pretending to eye up some value in what was definitely past prime
fish. He carefully studied the cart to see if he could pick out something worth enough. He saw it. Some electrical
component for an engine that he didn't recognize outright, but understood it's value all the same. Time to move in.

He haphazardly walked around until he landed in front of their cart, making eye contact with the man standing at the
front, while spotting the woman standing around back of it.

"What can I help you with?" the merchantman asked.

"Clearly, not much." Hector started. "It's not like you've much of anything valuable that I couldn't get somewhere else
for cheaper." Hector fired back. He had to be harsh upfront with these people.

"That's pretty bold, but I'm sure you want something all the same" The merchant replied deftly. Damn, he wasn't about to
back down from Hector's shot.

"There is, but it's not on your cart. I want to speak to your boss."

"My boss? She's not my boss, I am." He replied, clearly offended now.

Hector saw the woman lean out from the other side of the cart, clearly confused about what was happening and about to
come over to see why she'd been mentioned indirectly.

"Not her. Your real boss" Hector voiced as firmly as he could. "Who ever lets you run your shop. Who you pay tithes
too." He added. He knew this would set things straight.

"Oh" The man paused, still offended and coming to an understanding of what I wanted from him. "If that's the case then
why don't I just call some help over and get you thrown out." The woman had wandered past the edge of the cart, and was
standing just behind the man now. Hector quickly stepped forward to interrupt the man before he could yell, or indicate
to his partner to fetch it.

"It'll look better for you if you help me" Hector said. "I'm hiring some muscle for a job, and I need introductions. We
both know you have ties, so how about you quit playing koy and bring me to your boss. I'll even throw you a bone after
were done." Hector made sure to accentuate that last part. The man looked unconvinced, and the woman was about ready to
give her own thoughts when Hector noticed both their eyes leave him for someone behind him. He'd been running hot this
whole time, but something just then made his blood go cold. He could hear a crunch of boots on gravel and pavement as
whomever was behind him took their last step to see what was going on. He summoned all his courage to turn around with
his practiced composure, but he felt like it wouldn't be enough.

He was about an arm's length from a man who was mostly beard. He was half a head shorter than Hector, had a weather worn
black leather storm jacket with a hood attached, and a big revolver pistol in a holster across his chest. His big grey
beard was touching the holster and made his face look small by comparison. His long greying hair was tied back around
his head, exposing a receding hairline and weather hardened reddened skin on his ears and nose. He had a metal bat which
he was currently using like a cane some rich person might use, which is to say he didn't need it and liked to twirl it
around to get people attention with. While he was shorter than Hector, this man was twice as wide in both directions.
Hector knew who he was already.

"What's the problem here?" McClouyt asked. His voice sounded like the very gravel on the pavement he'd probably crushed
moments ago.

"This fella' want's to have a chat with you." Said the merchant.

"Well I'm here, better make it quick before I have my boys throw you out!" McClouyt said angrily.

This was about to go very poorly for Hector. The McClouyt couldn't see his face yet, and it's not like Hector had a
unique look he wore everywhere. He could see the man out of the corner of his eye, and assumed that since he was still
standing he still had a chance. His brain fired on all cylinders trying to think up how he was going to smooth this
over. Maybe he wouldn't get recognized? Maybe he could carry through with his plan? Maybe it could still work? His gut
said nope.

He took a step closer to the stall merchant until he was standing between them with his back fully to McClouyt and said
"I don't think this guy gets it McClouyt, he just doesn't seem to get who we are." In one smooth motion Hector placed
his hands on the merchantman's shoulders, grabbed tight and threw him with all his might into the gang boss. The mans
face went from the discontent of being insulted like this into a scowl of confusion and then a mask of horror as he
quickly understood what was happening, but was too slow to do anything about it. The last thing Hector saw as he took
off running was the flailing arms of McClouyt underneath the man as he was toppled backwards. That must've been some
shook to him as Hector didn't think someone as wide as him could be toppled over so completely. Hector had heard that
McClouyt was part of a family of deckhands that had converted to crime and smuggling after the fall of the fisheries
some generations ago. Clearly the steadfast balance necessary for ship-work hadn't stayed with them on land. Or he'd
just been really taken off guard after having a man throw at him mid conversation.

All of this happened in a the blink of an eye as Hector took off past the cart towards the market perimeter. On his way
past he snagged the part off the shelf and continued to pick up speed as he made his escape. He angled around the rear
of the cart, hoping to put something solid between him and the angry people behind him. He pumped his legs and breathed
hard as his already dilapidated body protested. He knew it was do or die and so he focused on getting out. He eye'd a
shop corner at the end of the square. It'd put some real cover between him and the gang members who were about to catch
onto what he'd done. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the woman in the leather vest looking at him with a started
look as he made his escape. He ran across the concrete and along the broken glass and trash littered outside the
shopfronts and buildings surrounding the square. he didn't slow down as he neared the corner and instead reach out with
his right hand to grab the corner and swing around into the alley. Just as he was swinging around he heard a loud bang
and a saw small explosion of concrete on the alley wall opposite him. They'd clearly figured out he was up to no good.

His momentum kept him going as he swung into the alley and bounced off the opposite wall. His feet struggled to keep up
with maneuver and he'd probably have fallen if not for bouncing off the wall and loosing a bunch of momentum. He
immediately leapt over some trash and broken bottles to keep from falling and built up speed again to make for opposite
end of the alley. Over the sound of his feet crunching on gravel and the blood pumping through his eyes he thought he
heard yelling behind him. As he reached the end of the alley he turned to see if anyone was following him. He squinted
to try and make out if the blurry shapes at the end where people or trash.

"-et em!" Someone yelled down the alley.

They were following him. It was probably a matter of professional integrity. They couldn't let someone steal from their
territory, and they definitely couldn't let someone make a fool of them by tossing bodies at them. He didn't even think
they knew that he'd already ripped them off which would make a trifecta that Hector ws sure would seal his fate in the
worst kind of way.

He started down the street continuing towards the seawall and towards a gate he knew. The road was crowded with garbage
and fallen buildings. He ran along the road passing rusted hulks and bones of vehicles that had been stripped for parts
and value. After only a half a dozen meters he realized he'd never make it out of eyesight so instead of running he half
dived, half tumbled into the a derelict two story building on his right. The front door had been blown outward and the
building was leaning heavily forwards, as if about to fall on the road. He scrambled on all fours past the entry area
and realized he was in some shop who's contents had long since been looted. He made for the counter and curled around it
to hide from his pursuers. His heart was pumping and his head felt ready to burst. His legs shook from all the effort
and he willed all of it to stop lest someone hear him. He strained his ears to listen for anyone. It was hard to tell
over the thump thump of his heart and the raspy breathing in his lungs, but he didn't hear anyone close at least. A
second later he heard clumping boots jogging past his hideaway and then shortly after another set of louder boots.

"Keep going, I'm going to hold hear incase he doubles back." Someone said. It wasn't McClouyt, but some other man.

Hector carefully pulled his knees underneath himself and made to lean out from around the counter at the lowest angle he
could manage. He knew that he had to be ready, and he willed his body into submission for the precision this would
require. He carefully stuck his head out, muscles in agony from the great effort he was subjecting them to, and looked
out the front of the shop. He could barely make out the man obscured behind some busted up shelf that had collapsed
inside the shop. The man was wearing a leather jacket, and had a thick metal pipe with a makeshift grip of tape and some
nuts. He was standing in the middle of the street eyeing up and down the road for Hector. Hector braced for a moment and
waiting to see if the gangster would leave or if he'd have to find another way out. Since he'd just down an adjacent
alleyway, it was entirely possible that he was trapped. The thought of what they might do if they captured him was not
something he even wanted to continue past his already limited imagining of 'bad'. Carefully scuttled bck and sat down to
try and take proper stock of his surroundings. It was a tiny place. There were broken shelving units upturned near the
entrance, and deeper past that there was a thick layer of dust collecting on the barren metal unit that remained
upright. It looked like the shop had been ling since abandoned by anyone, probably since it was leaning well into the
roadway. Hector could see cracks all along the walls and even some small gaps that he imagined lead to the next door
building. There was a door, but it was perfectly in line with the one he'd come in via. He'd had to expose himself to
view just to try the thing, which he knew would be locked since it closed. Nobody left an unlocked door open these days.
Twisting around he tried to see if there was anything he could use or escape via deeper inside the shop. The wall had
actually toppled over next to him behind the counter, and he couldn't get past it from this side. He decided it was
probably his best bet to try for the other side and escape out the back. He had to slowly lift his head above the
counter to try and see a way around and when he cleared the counter he froze. The gangster was facing him outside and
seemed to be looking right at him. The man had a tense look on his face.

"What are you doing here? I told you to get after em!" A gravely voice boomed.

Hector realized McClout must be directly between them, but was just too short to see. If this had been any other
situation Hector might've chuckled a bit.

"...orry boss. I'll check these buildings while you hold the road." Hector caught the man apologizing.

The gangster turned around and started at the building across the road, trying to look capable and hard working. Despite
not being able to see the gang boss, Hector kne this would be his best chance. He snuck around the counter, the same way
he had come in and crept low across the open gap between the toppled shelves and the one still standing on the other
side of the entrance. He actually made it to the shelves and slowly stood up into a crouch while moving around the
collapsed wall. He could see that it had only collapsed on his side and was actually just leaning forwards, but still
partially intact. Behind it he made out some metal stairs leading to the next floor up. This was it, he could feel it.
He'd get out just like he always did. He slowly crept up to the wall and was about to stretch his arms for purchase when
he heard a bang-crack. McClouyt was standing right in front and had his revolver pointed at him. There was smoke coming
from the barrel and for a second Hector felt like he'd been shot and just couldn't feel it yet. He thought he'd locked
eyes for a second, until he realized that McClouyt was looking right next to him. He turned to see a poster of some
worker on the wall next to him with a hole in it's face. McClouyt was squinting to see inside, and Hector had only lived
because it was so dark. No more hiding, he'd never get luckier than this.

Hector leapt up with all his might and scrambled up the leaning wall towards the stairs. One hand after the other he
pulled himself up the wall towards the stairs. He was slipping on the paneling and he almost fell outright if not for a
pipe sticking vertically from the ceiling. Using this he pulled - jumped for the stairs landing hard into them just as
another bullet slammed into the wall. From here he could see that the stairs were unusable below him and he'd someone
found the only way up. He hauled himself up, headless of the creaking and snapping that he was causing on this rusted
piece of metal that was supporting his weight. He skipped the next dangerously angled step and then ran headlong the
rest of the way up. He'd cleared line of sight now and finally checked in front of himself. He made it to a small
landing and saw at the end was a door. He tried to door, and it was predictably locked. He took a step back and heal
kicked it right next to the bolt. It groaned, but didn't give. He kicked it again and again. He could hear yelling
bellow him as the gangers attempted to duplicate his acrobatic feat. He reflexively ducked as a shot ricocheted off the
wall and into the ceiling above him. They were clearly having trouble getting up, but that didn't mean much if he was
trapped up here. Eventually they'd make it up and when they did he was done for. The door was slowly bending, but it
wasn't fast enough. He looked around for any other escape, but there wasn't anything. His time was up. He'd finally
bitten off more than he could chew. His mistakes had caught up to him. He turned and slumped against the door. He sat
hard on the dusty floor, and something in his pocket clinked. He reached in and removed it. It was the part he'd stolen.
He looked at it a bit closer and saw it was some sort of motor and gear assembly about the size of his fist. He turned
it over is his hands, and wondered how much it was actually worth. They were probably gonna haul him outside and
splatter his brains over a piece of scrap worth less than their guns. He heard yelling now, coming from bellow, and he
thought he could hear metal scraping concrete. They were going to use one of the shelves to get up here. Good thinking
on their part. He fumbled the part into the floor and it make a solid clunk without bouncing. He stopped. This was going
to save him. He grabbed the part and turned to swing it at the door knob. He lined it up, and gave a hesitant first
swing to judge his aim with. It gave a small clank and bounced back off the metal knob. He hefted the part in his hand,
confident in his grip and swung harder this time. A more satisfying thump now. Now he really gave it some effort, and
swung multiple times over and and over with all his strength. Slowly the door knob loosened and bent. The metal shearing
apart at the seems and the screws holding it together slowly stripping free from their moorings. He gave one last
desperate swing and the knob sheared off, and bounced on the floor. He tossed his supposed prize aside and reached into
the door assembly to work the bolt free. He wiggled the parts around until the bolt gave way just a touch. He stepped
back for another kick, and for s second thought he heard something creak behind him. He turned slightly and saw one of
the gangers, gun in hand scrambling up the broken stairs towards him. They were moving much more carefully than he had
and that gave him precious seconds to escape. He turned forwards and gave one final savage kick. The bolt pinged off,
and the door bounced inwards and then swung back out towards him bellowing dust behind it.

"you're not getting away!" yelled the man.

He ran full tilt into the room just as the man he'd seen watching outside crested the landing, on his way in he turned
to grab the door knob on the inside, hopping to hold it back and block the man. Just before he made it, he felt a sharp
jerking motion across his neck as he was hauled back by the hood of his jacket. He tumbled backwards and landed on his
ass, only to be pulled further back by the man. Suddenly there was gun in his face, and he stopped resisting for a
second.

"Thought you could get away? The boss is fuming from what you did, we're gonna make an example out of you."

"Doubt it." Hector said. "I bet he'll put me in charge of you afterwards."

"Shut the fuck up!" He yelled and then took a swing at Hector with the pistol. Right as it connected with his face,
Hector felt something jab into his side. He grasped the familiar shape he'd just tossed away, and knew it hadn't used up
it's usefulness yet. He swung it around and connected it with the mans face, and they traded blows. While the ganger had
only intended to subdue him, Hector had been swinging for his life. There was a loud crack, only partially dulled by the
low thump of his own head bouncing off the floor. He immediately reached up to hold his head with his other hand, vision
blurry for all of a few seconds. He felt dizzy, but the other guy was down too now. Scrambling onto his knees he dived
on top of him and swung again with the battered chunk of metal in his hands. The man was defenseless and tried to turn
the gun towards Hector. He dropped his hand from his throbbing head and leaned all his weight into it to prop the gun
away from himself. With his other hand he swung again, aiming for another blow to the head. It connected, and he heard a
wet crack noise this time.

The man went limp, and his grip on the gun relaxed. Hector was dazed. It could only have been seconds, but the moment
seemed to stretch for eternity. He sat staring at the man, laying unconscious on the floor. Hector could feel the
adrenalin pumping through his veins fading. He was going to be very sick soon. He looked across the man towards the gun
and took it. Legs unsteady, he stood up and turned around. Broken metal in one hand and gun in the other he stumbled
towards the door, he'd only moments earlier smashed open. He walked into the next room, and looked around. It was a
dusty mess of papers and some floor to ceiling shelves. Nothing was on them, and he could see piles of empty boxes
towards the back. He heard indistinct yelling and then a crash from downstairs. He ignored it. Walking forwards he was
struggling to figure out an escape that would get him free of this nightmarish day.

He stepped forwards and padded slowly past the empty shelves. Dust covered everything, swirled around him as he plodded
towards the back of the room. It was cleared here, and he could see that the room encompassed the entire second floor.
No more doors, or stairs, just eery silence. He turned to follow a wall and turned his eyes up to see his savior. Behind
the stairs, and the landing he saw a ladder with roof access. Stuffing the hunk of metal and gun into his jacket
pockets, he picked up the pace towards the ladder. He could see that it was locked, but from the inside this time. Dust
coated the rungs, and soon coated his hands as he reached out and grasped the firm metal. Hand over hand he climbed
upwards, until he reached the latch securing the concave panel shut.Holding tight with one hand, he reached for the
lever and gave it a sharp tug. It groaned, but budged slightly. He tugged again, and he didn't know who was louder as he
leaned out and groaned to shift his weight behind it. There was a rusty pop and the panel lifted slightly. Dust and cool
air wafted down onto his face, and he stepped up to push the panel open completely. Rusty hinges creaked and complained,
but he didn't care. The cover swung clear and Hector hoisted himself onto the roof, breathing the cold air from his new
vantage point.

He could hear faint screaming from bellow. It sounded angry and exasperated. He'd clearly gotten one over them, and it
was not going to go over well. The thing with these gangs, everyone was always reporting to someone else. No matter how
far up the food chain you made it, there was always someone holding your leash. It just changed hands, but they never
gave you any slack. Hector had exploited that once or twice, but for the most part he'd had to forestall any bigger
plays given what they'd cost. He valued his independence more than most. Trading his independence for temporary safety
just didn't seem like the smart play. He'd seen enough people loose that trade to turn him off making the same mistake
for life. He'd made plenty of other mistakes anyways and his luck was going to run out someday.

He walked towards the side of the roof and hoped down the few feet onto the neighboring building roof. He walked at a
leisurely pace, knowing that he was as good as gone, and could afford to take his time. Crossing a few other roofs, up
and down a few feet at each interval he eventually had to judge a gap for jumping across. It was still 2 stories down,
and Hector didn't see any ladders or safe way down. Most of these buildings were dangerously unstable and therefore
abandoned, so he could break into this one and make his way out of the area through the ground floor. He walked back
from the edge, and tried the roof access hatch. It was locked with a rusty chain, but the anchor had almost no hold
left. He could wiggle it already, and all it needed was one good pull break it free. He reached down with both hands and
lifted with his back. It didn't snap free in some dramatic motion, but slowly bent off until it was basically useless.
He held the hatch open while awkwardly turning around and lowering himself into the building. Unlike his recent
struggle, this building gave way to him very easily. He was of course on the inside, so all the doors locked the other
way. He made his way through the building and found a side door leading into the alley he'd been tempted to jump just
minutes before. He winced when he pushed rusty door open, worried that the fishermen had decided to search the whole
area, but nothing happened and he quickly left. After zigging and zagging down some alleys and roads, he was finally
headed to his next hurdle. This one he was confident it, and he'd acquired a new bargaining chip to negotiate with.

After walking for an hour he finally reached his old stomping grounds. He'd arrived at the wall a few minutes ago, and
had followed it towards an old high-rise building. It had been some big corporation tower back in the day, but these
days it served a much worse purpose. The building itself reminded hector of how he felt. It was old and stripped bare
with ragged sheets flapping out windows. Most of the windows had been smashed inwards from weather or from building
stress. Sections of exterior paneling had been ripped off from storms and from age. Broken furniture, old scraps of
fabric, and trash was scattered all around it. It looked haunted and ominous, the sheets and rags a withered cloak
hiding some ancient dark-magic human. Even the dark interior felt like it was howling moans of **sadness** and
suffering. The building hungered for souls, and here hector was going to willingly enter. He knew it was just a facade,
a trick, and a well thought out one at that. It was the same everywhere. Big fronts hiding the truth to keep people out
and away. Only the desperate or the brave ever made the push to find something underneath. He had been desperate once.
He had seen what lay behind the mask and he had realized that people were the exact same way.

He walked in through a broken window into the **entry_way**, and felt eyes following him. He knew better than to try and
stare them down and instead kept moving towards a desk, intending for the door behind it. He went into the door and was
immediately greeted by a gun held loosely at head height.

"Hows it going Hector?" Alvarez said.

He'd been expecting this. The room was dimly lit with a single ancient lightbulb which was why Hector didn't see him at
first. It cast the room in an amber glow and shrouded the corners and furniture in darkness. Hector wasn't afraid, he
knew Alvarez would let him talk.

"Better than you. I'm still out and about. Building up for a job. Want in?" He asked.

Alvarez lowered the gun a little. Instead of at Hector's head, it was now loosely aimed at his chest. "I dunno, what's
in it for me?"

"Enough for a ticket out of here probably. Maybe even enough to set you up someplace with better lighting." Hector
stepped forwards and went to sit on a desk just inside the room. "In the meantime, I need access." He sat down and
released a breath that he hadn't noticed he'd been holding. Alvarez tracked him for a second with the gun, but soon let
it drop to his side when he reached the desk.

"I don't wanna bother with your gig, but I'll open the doors if you have something to barter." He stashed his pistol in
his pocket. Alvarez walked towards the desk and pulled out some cigarettes offering one to Hector before taking one
himself. He then pulled a lighter and lit his own before gesturing to Hector.

"Thanks. And I do have something." Hector accepted the cigarette and leaned in to accept a light. He held up his hand,
and pulled the part from his pocket. It had a small dent, complete with a few hairs and blood stuck to the side. Hector
quickly wiped it off on his jacket front, and held it up to the lightbulb for Alvarez to inspect.

"That is what you want to barter with?" He chuckled at him. "That's a piece of junk 'H, even you know that." Alvarez
reached out to take it from Hector.

Hector pulled it away. "I'm sure you can work your magic on it. Besides you're always looking for spares." He nodded to
the room. "I know there's stuff that you need fixing, and I'm sure you'll be able to con someone else into getting you
what you need. I know I'm not your only customer."

"That's true. But you're the only one who uses the basement. Nobody is that desperate anymore." Alvarez held a hand out
waiting for Hector to give him the part.

Hector handed him the hunk of metal, and crossed his arms expectantly. He didn't want to trade the gun, but he needed to
get home. Alvarez was a local mechanic who had figured out how to get power from the underground back up to the
building. Alvarez was smart, but he had no idea what was beneath them, and what sort of riches there were if only you
had the balls to take it.

The orange zone was barely habitable. Buildings were in ruins, or about to be in ruins. Most of the supporting
infrastructure was damaged or just plain gone, and what was left were buildings so precarious they leaned into one
another rather than stand on their own. With the violent weather thrown in, it was a miracle any of it lasted. Scraps
and rags were battered into nothing, metal rusted into dirty smudges, but somehow the concrete lasted in places most
considered unfit for living. If this was a corpse, then the orange zone would be the rotting remains. Only the vultures
and truly desperate scavengers remained. But the red zone was something else. Most of the red zone was outside the sea
wall. Concrete structures that withstood the water despite the floods. Only a few buildings even cleared the swells
anymore, but they lasted. Nobody could live out there. There was just simply too much to go wrong. Boats couldn't come
in due to the risk of puncturing their hulls on some structure bellow the water. Or even getting thrashed by wash and
wind. Currents were so strong that if you fell in, you didn't drown, but were mauled and bludgeoned to death on the
buildings and hidden concrete shoals. Even fish had a tough time existing there, which is why the pickings were so slim.
Of course that was above the waterline. Hector had learned one day that the city had had a huge underground network of
tunnels. Some were old subway tunnels, some were building access, and some were storage. While lots had flooded, there
were still pockets of air, and paths between them. Some people even talked about bunkers from the war or earlier. Places
that had been built in secret by either governments or corporations for unknown reasons. Indeed Hector had heard about
horror stories of people wandering into labs and depots, only to get violently murdered by long forgotten experiments or
left over traps. Some people even talked about mutants wandering the tunnels, killing randomly, and then retreating into
the darkness. It all sounded much worse than he knew it as.

Alvarez turned the part over in his hands, pulled a few straw hairs off, and took a drag off his cigarette. "I can't
make this work. You gotta do better." He said, with the cigarette between his lips. "Go back out ang get me something
better, and then maybe I can make this work."

Hector took a long pull on his cigarette and reached into his pocket. Killing Alvarez would be tough. He knew how to
keep the lights on, and he bartered for other parts Hector could then barter in turn to other people. So that wasn't an
option. He carefully, and with exaggerated slowness pulled the pistol out of his pocket. He held it pinched between his
thumb and fingers like a pice of trash you didn't want to dirty your palms on. He then carefully laid it onto the desk
beside him and pushed it towards Alvarez.

"Who'd you steal that from?" Alvarez asked.

"Doesn't matter. That, with the coupler is enough. Now boot it up, and get the elevator working." He said grumpily. He
really didn't want to give him the gun. It was worth more than what he was asking, and one thing to count on was that
nobody in this town ever remembered favors. Hector certainly didn't.

Alvarez took the gun by the grip, looked it over and then opened one of the drawers and put it inside. Then locked it
with a key from his pocket. "Lets go." He said and went for a door at the back of the room.

Hector got up and followed. The room itself was sparsely filled, and only now that Hector's eyes had adjusted could he
see everything. He knew the door had been there, he'd been here before, but for some reason he felt dizzy and lost.
Probably just the final effects of his hangover. Alvarez pulled the door open and gestured Hector inside. Hector went in
and Alvarez ticked off the single light, and locked the door behind him. They followed the new room, which was a dimly
lit hallway, to a service door halfway down. Pipe dripped condensation, and dust gave the indication that nobody
explored beyond what had been lit up. Hector got to the door first and pushed it open, already knowing what was inside.

Inside was an elevator lift. It had been industrial in nature, which was probably why Alvarez had been able to get it
working. It was a yellow square on vertical rails, that didn't go above the main floor, but obviously went into the
buildings sub levels. There was a waist-high railing, with chipped yellow paint encircling the lift, and a small gate
that Hector opened and stepped inside. Alvarez walked past the lift towards a stack of boxes and what looked like junk,
but was probably parts, or scrap he was keeping. Hector couldn't see what he was doing, but he heard a small grunt, and
some clicks followed by a low hum and some lights come on on a panel attached to the lift railing. Alvarez came back
from behind the boxes and closed the gate behind him while he flicked some switches on the panel. The lift lurched down,
and for a second Hector was worried something had broken, but then it started slowly whining and they descended
smoothly. Alvarez turned to face him, with a wry grin on his face, keeping his one hand on the controls.

"Thought that was it eh?" He said, clearly aware of what he'd done.

Hector didn't say anything and instead turned to look at the slowly moving walls as they descended into the lower
levels. It was actually quite a ways down. Hector couldn't tell how far it was, but they stood there for about 10
minutes. They passed a few doors, but they were unevenly spaced and Hector had never asked Alvarez. Taking short drags
on his cigarette, Hector watched incase he could see any lights. He saw none. When they reached the bottom he flicked
away the butt down into the gap. Alvarez had stopped the lift, and he went to the door, which was lit from the other
side, and swung it open. The air that wafted out was stale and humid, but certainly not bad. Hector stepped up slightly,
as the lift had gone past this floor and turned to see if Alvarez was going to follow him. He wasn't surprised when
Alvarez didn't move and instead waved him on. He closed the door and Alvarez unceremoniously set the lift to return to
the top. "Yeah, fuck you too" Hector muttered and the lift slowly whined out of earshot. The lights were only coming
from some emergency paneling on the other side of the tunnel. Hector's eyes had adjusted uch more on the way down, and
he could see other small sources leading down and curving out of sight in both directions. He dropped down from the
ledge the door was on onto some dusty and chipped cement, reached under a rock for flashlight he kept hidden, turned
right, and started walking.

It had been a long time since he'd found this place. He still remembered how scared and jumpy he'd been. He had geared
up and brought lights, a gun, and even some basic gear for exploring the tunnels. He'd been intent to discover some long
hidden bunker, or cache and make it rich selling off the contents. Of course that had not happened, but he had still
gotten extremely lucky. He'd found a place to call home. He hadn't been alone, at least metaphorically speaking. While
he had gone alone, he'd known that other people had also tried exploring. They'd been like him, exploring the literal
depths to try and gain their freedom. Riches could exist down here, but as far as Hector was concerned those riches
weren't accessible to people like him anymore. You needed an edge to make it, and while living down here could be
considered an edge, he'd yet to really capitalize on it.

Hector walked a route he'd long since memorized. It had a few turns, but it wasn't particularly obfuscated. The tunnels
were all concrete and steel. Some were old rail lines, some were access lines, and for one stretch he had to cross a
small alcove that looked like storage area. The concrete tunnels were all cracked, and rusted. The air was always stale
and damp. There were puddles, and sections with waist high water. He thankfully didn't have to cross those. Something
seemed different about the alcove today. It had been empty since he'd found the place, but today it seemed smaller and
somehow denser. The rounded concrete ceiling was almost swirling or threaded. He played his light from end to end,
trying to figure out what he was looking at, trying to discern what he was seeing. He checked the lense on his light,
but it didn't look damaged ot dirty. The ceiling had acquired some sort of pattern like a swirling river, or an eddying
tide. Full of parallel lines curving across it. It looked like a ripple, but with the center being somewhere far away.
Far away in the direction he was heading. Unable to make heads or tail of it, he figured it must have always been that
way, and kept walking. After a good thirty more minutes he finally arrived. He was facing a steel door with a small
keypad next to it. He walked up to the keypad to enter the combo he'd been lucky enough to guess that first trip so long
ago. He paused, as he noticed a strange smell. It had an ionized sting to it. Maybe like ozone, or something that had
burned extremely hot and left a burnt smell in the air. He stopped, and carefully played the light over his
surroundings. He had never really payed attention to the rubble, and the tunnels leading in and out, but now he examined
each one to determine if it had been that way last time. The smell was gone, but he still waited patiently. Sometimes
gasses drifted in and out, but he was cautious. He checked the door, a double wide steel block without windows or even
handles. There were no scorch marks, or new looking dents. There weren't any, so he continued with the key combination.
Following the beeps on the number keys, there was a click, and a whine as the door whined slightly while it raised. He
couldn't shake his paranoia, so he stooped down and scooted inside before it finished, and quickly made for the control
panel to lower it. He hit the switch and watched carefully to make sure nobody ran up with a wedge or something to block
it open, and only once it closed did he let out his breath.

There were lights inside. Very dim lights, but they seemed bright after the tunnel. He took off his jacket and drooped
it on a nearby chair. He'd rearranged the place from how it had initially been laid out for his own needs. Not that he
needed much. He walked onwards into a side room, and grabbed a ration bar from inside. This place had been a bunker, but
not the important kind. As far as Hector could tell it was some sort of storage setup for a long gone corporation. It
was filled with stored food, and documents. There were even some data drives in boxes he'd found. While this place did
have power, it was the emergency lighting, and wasn't enough to turn on the computers. He'd tried bringing one of the
drives up to the surface, but it had melted as soon as he'd plugged it into a laptop. He'd been told off that day for
almost destroying a perfectly good laptop, and he had decided that the drives must be tamper proofed somehow. Stuffing
his face with a ration bar, he walked towards the main area where he kept more of his stuff.

He had moved around most of the stuff and had partitioned off an area for his bed room. Behind a wall stack of documents
he'd arranged some blankets on a palette he'd ripped apart to make a frame with. He went to sit on his bed, exhausted
from his odyssean journey of the day when he stopped. That smell was back. His blood ran cold and all he could hear was
his heart pounding in his ears. His gut told him he was not alone. Despite the logical side of his brain firing on all
cylinders to prove he had been careful, his gut was a hundred percent confident someone had gotten here before him. He
swallowed his mouthful of food, and reached under the makeshift bed for a pipe he kept there. He almost lost it when he
had to blindly grasped for it, but then found it after a few seconds. His hands were shaking, and his ears were
pounding. He willed his brain to focus and listened for anything to suggest movement somewhere. He could still smell the
same thing as outside, but it did not seem to be directional. Then he heard it. A low whining noise, that he had not
noticed because it almost blended in with the background noise of the lights and electrical panels. This one seemed to
ebb and flow, and had some low burps that made him think of whales or deep water mammals. It was coming from the back of
the room. He slowly got up and peered around his makeshift wall. There were more stacks and boxes in the way, but now
that he was aware of it the sound was definitely coming from a corner. It was the corner where he kept the data drives.
He took small, and careful steps towards the corner. He was careful to keep the boxes between him and whoever was back
there until the for as long as possible. He lifted up his arms until the pipe was over his shoulders, ready to take a
swing. He inched to the corner of the boxes,trying to muster his willpower for what he was sure would happen next. His
heart was racing, and his blood was hot now. He could feel the adrenaline pumping through his veins.

In one smooth motion he turned the corner, roaring as load as he could, holding the pipe high for a quick blow to the
head. There was a crouched figure facing into the corner, not looking towards him. He could not tell its gender, but it
was covered in a hooded cloak. For a split second Hector thought he heard whispering, then the figure turned towards
him. He was charging full tilt and couldn't make out a face, but he saw the eyes. They were two points of light and
darkness, somehow both at once and somehow swirling within the sockets. As soon as he looked fully into those orbits,
Hector's world exploded.

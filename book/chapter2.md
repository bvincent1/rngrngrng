"Ding Ding".

Arthur heard the chime.

"Ding ding"

This time he acknowledged it and reach over for his phone on the sill.

"You awake?" A chipper female voice asked.

"Wasn't asleep." He lied back to her.

"Good, 'cause I have a job for you." She responded, omitting any comments on wether or not she believed him.

Arthur sat up quickly, willing himself to be awake. He needed this job, but he didn't want to sound too desperate. He
had his pride to protect.

"Order just came in. Need you to find someone. Her name is Lili Kant."

He nodded his head to no-one in particular, trying to absorb the info into his still half asleep brain. "What does the
client need?" He asked, hopping that he wasn't making himself look like a fool.

"Just info. Need to know were she is, or were she's going. You're trailing a lead, not bringing anyone in." The female
voice carefully explained, with a hint of concern in her voice. "I'm sending the location to you now, get there quickly.
I need this."

She didn't have to say that again. He needed this probably more than she did. Without waiting for him to acknowledge she
hung up, and he pulled his phone off his face. A second later he got a notification and tapped the link. Rikki was
always nice that way. Rikki was a dispatcher, and lately he'd been getting most of his work from her. He was vaguely
aware that she worked from home and that she was mostly a tech specialist who'd doubled into finding work online for
people like him. He'd yet to meet her in person, but she seemed nice enough the way she talked to him and treated him.

Arthur watched as the app opened and the route loaded onto the map. A line connected between him and the dot where the
address was. He studied the map's directions, then pocketed his phone. He jumped into his boots on the floor at the edge
of his bed and reached for his stash of gear. Pocketing most of it, he searched for his jacket and found it in the floor
were he'd foolishly discarded it. Pulling it over his arms and smoothing the fit, he did one last check of his tiny
apartment and went to leave. He swung his hallway door open and went for the stairwell. His door was keypad operated so
h didn't have to wait for it. It also meant that he'd loose access if his funds ran out. He always kept that in mind
when leaving. He walked briskly down the hall, tails of his longer black jacket sweeping out behind him. He made good
time down the stairwell and by the time he reached the bottom floor his heart was racing from excitement and from
exertion. He needed this job, and he was an equal mix of anxious and excited. He needed this done so he could catch up
on things he'd been slacking on.

He pushed the stairwell door open and emerged into the early evening air. He started walking towards the nearest rail
station. He wasn't more than a block away from a station, so he knew he'd make good time. Emerging onto a main street
from the alley behind his building, people passed on his left and right, and Arthur did his best to ignore all of them.
Even though it was late, there was always people moving from one place to another. Arthur liked watching them from his
window, he liked imagining what reasons people had to be out and about if they weren't like him. At the doors to the
rail station he heard an chime, and he paused his rush so he could focus and listen. The prerecorded voice announced
that his train would arrive shortly. He stepped faster than he'd have liked in order to make it in time. Steps flew
past, and corners blurred as he half walked, half jogged to make it. He arrived at the **stand** and found he had a
minute to spare. He was slightly out of breath, and felt his blood pumping from the exertion. He tried to slow his
breathing, and get his heartbeat back to a relaxed speed. Slow was smooth, smooth was fast. Breathe.

Despite the late hour, the train was not empty. He had to walk towards the back to find a seat. Arthur sat heavily in a
window seat and turned to look out at the far side of the tunnel wall, blurring past him.

Arthur found he was feeling solemn about the state of things. He felt like he and everything around him was on the brink
of collapsing. Mostly he blamed the megacorps for their collective predicament. The 'corps were too busy and greedy to
notice that they were eroding the very soil they built on. Arthur saw the people pushed to the brink by policies and
monetizations resort to fighting everyone they could just to hold on. Some chose to fight the megacorps, but those
people soon found out that military contracts were a core investment, and by consequence those victims were promptly
squashed by overpowered military might. Other people, perhaps the marginally smarter ones, chose to fight each other.
Those ones made gangs, and did their best to carve out kingdoms of their own. Crime was rampant throughout the city, and
only the mega rich could afford the security necessary to avoid it. Everyone else was left to fend for themselves.

Even the weather felt hostile. Being next to ocean, the city had always been subjected to harsher rain and wind, but
lately more and more problems had cropped up. Buildings collapsing from eroded foundations and strong winds. Rain
acidity causing concrete to deteriorate faster than expected, **necessing** costly repairs.

His phone dinged again, breaking morose train of thought, and an update from Rikki popped onto the banner. 'Remember,
they just wanna know where the perp went. Don't get involved, don't cause a scene.'. As if he needed a reminder. He
pocketed his phone. A few minutes later, he got out, and ascended from the underground rail. It had started raining
slightly on his way over, and small droplets pattered on the glass windows and concrete walls just outside the station.
He pulled up his hood and collar, crossed the building threshold out into the street and started towards the address. He
walked briskly and with purpose, trying his best to project an attitude of 'don't fuck with me'. Arthur found that
attitude made up a big part of separating those whom did get into trouble and those whom did not. Despite the violence,
weapons were fairly simple. Guns were semi-common, but more often attackers would use blunt tools. Arthur himself
carried an extendable rod, preferring the low profile approach to violence. Before all this, he'd joined the military,
and to his surprise been appraised as an expert scout. His natural tendency for stealth, combined with his perfect sense
of direction had helped him get noticed early on in his training. He'd been destined for a role in the
**scouting_regiment** before things had gone sideways. Despite that, he'd always retained his skills, and as he got
closer to the block he slowed from a brisk walk into a quiet prowl. He approached the final corner, and stopped just
short. He patted his jacket pocket for the reassuring weight of the extendable baton. Once he felt it, he leaned out
from behind the corner to peer around the corner for the target building.

The street was flanked with rows of skinny midsize rises, each about 3 to 5 floors high. The street itself was bare
except for a few scraps of trash littering the steps of the various rises. There were no cars, and no people which felt
a bit odd. The rain had probably pushed everyone to leave for shelter. Thin gaps separated the buildings, that Arthur
was certain concealed tired and restless people, waiting for fairer weather, or for helpless victims to pass. He checked
the address again and confirmed that 'Lili' lived on the 3rd floor of the middle building across from him. He pulled out
his phone and messaged Rikki "Which room is hers? Perspective from the outside front of the building", and then pocketed
his phone instead of waiting for a reply. He turned around and made for the back of the building opposite his target.

He knew he didn't stand a chance of getting in the front, but he was counting on the element of surprise for this plan
he was quickly making up as he went along. Cutting through the alley he counted until he arrived at the rear of the
building opposite. He was looking to get onto the fire escape and make for the roof, but first he had to find something
to climb. Trash was haphazardly heaped against the walls, but none of it was stable enough to support his weight. He
looked around some more, and found a metal trash bin that looked passably stable. He carried it to under the ladder,
carefully flipped the bin upside down, and stood it underneath. Judging by the structural stability, he figured he'd
only get one chance at this. He carefully climbed onto the bin, taking care to place his boots near the edges were the
metal would be strongest. Once he was balanced he looked up and readied himself. He breathed in, then out, in, out. On
the next in, he tensed and pushed off with all his might. The bin buckled under the stress, and he felt one of feet slip
a bit, but it was enough. He reached out and his fingers made contact with the rusted rung. He hung on the rung while
the can clattered with a resounding bang. Turning slightly he swung his other hand up to make contact and strained his
muscles to pull himself up.

Arthur underestimated how much effort this was taking him. He pulled himself up, and remembered the endless exercises
and training he'd undergone. The screams and yells of instructors and fellow recruits flooded his memories as he muscled
up to the next bar. He made it up, and up, and before he knew it he was huffing on the metal grating of the first
landing. He took a moment to catch his breath as best he could, but he didn't want to stay longer in case that noise had
alerted someone looking to cause him trouble. He quickly ascended the grated metal steps, carefully testing his weight
in some of the more corroded sections. Before he knew it he was at the roof. It was painfully obvious he'd made it
because the rain and wind had picked up and were now battering him from what seemed like both sides.

He huddled on the roof, and slowly scooted towards the front. He pulled his jacket and hood tighter to protect himself
from the rain and wind. His jacket was an off black color and water resistant, but not water proof. He'd had it altered
and repaired a few times, extending the bottom hems, adding the hood, and adding snap-button along the front and a few
key spots in the back. All this careful attention to detail made it his most prized possession. It was silent and easy
to hide in. Both of which were vital to his profession. Even with all that, he'd still get soaked if he had to stay out
here much longer.

Once he reached the edge he pulled a monocular from his chest pocket. He carefully pulled it up to his eye, and scanned
the building across the street. It was dark now, so he could easily tell who was in and who was not based on the lights.
A careful scan of the 3rd floor told him that only one of the units was active. Their might still be people in the dark
ones, but at least they'd be slow to stir, or just simply ignore anything in favor of trying to get whatever sleep they
could. The entire thing was uninspired blocky architecture, and made with the same concrete that every construction
company used. The rooms themselves all had one unified balcony with divider walls separating each unit's alloted space.
Their were tarps covering boxes on several of the balconies, and the others had a an odd chair, or were empty. The rain
was coloring the concrete a darker grey, and combined with the wind was making a decent noise. Arthur relaxed a bit
since this meant he'd go completely unnoticed. Nothing to see here, just another pill of trash huddled against the
elements. He tried not to feel to literally about it.

Pulling the monocular away, he leaned forwards and pulled his phone out, careful not to get it wet. Hunched over his
phone, he dimmed the screen and checked for any replies from Rikki. She had responded with "3rd floor, far left". He
pocketed his phone and pulled his monocular back up to his face to better examine the target unit. The monocular didn't
have anything like a camera, night vision, or thermal imaging. Arthur had mostly used it recon, and didn't have the
money to invest in something like that. He'd once had to take pictures through it via his phone, but that was the most
technical he'd had to get. He slowly worked the focus and zoom until he could see into the unit via the balcony door and
window.

Since it was night he had a better time seeing inside the unit. Through the glass balcony door, he could make out a
small couch and a desk with a monitor on it. He couldn't see much else through the door, and he couldn't see at all
through the window, which he assumed was for the bedroom. He scooted across the roof to the other side to try and get a
better angle, but all he got was glare from an illuminated street sign down the street. it was still empty below him,
and the rain and wind was making it especially miserable. He could feel the water seeping into his clothes and he tried
to think of what to do next.

The job was to find this person, and they clearly weren't here. If there was more info Rikki would've told him. He
needed the cash, and he wouldn't get paid for showing up with nothing. Time to get resourceful. He secured the monocular
inside his jacket, and tried to figure out his next steps. He looked around and tried to see anything that he could use.
The building across from him was too tall to try his last trick with the fire escape, he'd have to spend all his time
climbing down balconies. But something like that might work on one of the neighbors. One of the neighboring building
looked like it jutted out slightly further than the target. If he could get onto its roof, he could jump off it onto the
balcony. There was only 1 floor height between the neighbor's roof, and the 3rd floor balcony. But how would he get onto
that neighboring roof?

He turned to face the neighbor straight on, and squinted to try and see past the rain whipping around. Arthur was one of
the few people left that didn't need glasses these days, as eyesight had gotten generationally poorer. Despite his above
average eyesight, he couldn't make out much. He was about to reach for the monocular, when he spotted it. Without
removing it from his pocket, he checked the time on his phone. Still good. He scuttled towards the edge of the building
he'd climbed and looked down. It was pitch black between the buildings, and he couldn't see the bottom in that gap. It
was pretty close between the two, but if he fell, that'd be it for him. Arthur backed up from the edge and squared up to
his target. He took a few breaths, and wiped his hands on the insides of his jacket to try and dry them off. They felt
clammy and slick. He'd be pushing his luck with this one. In three steps, he closed the gap and leapt.

Arthur felt weightless in the air, like he'd be able to jump across the whole street if he had tried. His arms were up
and reaching. He'd angled his approach and used the balustrade as a boost to do this. That trick had gained him the
extra feet he needed to make this work. All too quickly his outstretched hands slapped against the cold plastic of the
cabling, and he grabbed hold with all his might. He quickly swung his other arm to grab hold as well. He felt his
shoulder twinge, and he knew he should have stretched before all this.

Now he was hanging, swinging even, on some cabling suspended between the two buildings. He had guessed that the cable
could take his weight, but it had been a gamble. He hung there, suspended between two buildings, 4 stories up, soaking
wet, and questioning if the cable would hold his weight the whole time, or would detach part way through his highwire
act. Good thing the streets were empty, because between the cable twanging tight all of a sudden and the business sign
backlighting him someone would have surely noticed. He didn't have to worry about looking down, because it took his full
concentration to grab the cable. Hand over hand, he climbed forwards. He was only about halfway before he found a flaw
in his plan. The cable he was climbing across, like some playground equipment from his childhood, was sagging. He didn't
know what exactly it's purpose was, but clearly the installation engineer had not prepared it to support the weight of a
full grown man. Arthur knew it was too late to back down, so he kipped up and pulled his legs up onto the cable. Taking
the weight off his arms, left him more strength to focus on his grip. His willpower was strong, and that what mattered.
He pulled instead of swung now, and did his best to ignore the growing pain in his shoulder and the cold seeping into
every part of his body. This maneuver had opened him up to the elements on a whole new scale. His jacket was hanging off
him by the shoulders, and the rain was hammering his face. His hands would go numb soon, and when that happened, he
would be done for.

Hand over numbing hand, Arthur pulled himself along the cable until he reached the opposite building. He wedged his
shoulder right up against the concrete and reached up onto the roof. The concrete was even colder than the plastic and
he struggled to find purchase. Pulling himself overtop the cable, he could now see the roof and use his other hand to
drag himself over the lip, and onto the flat, graveled roof. He hauled himself into a crouched position on his knees.
His chest was heaving from the effort and his lungs ached. Gravel stung his hands and knees and clung to him where he'd
scraped it. The cold was still their but it had mixed with the warmth of exertion. Quickly, his lungs stopped aching,
and his breathing came under control. The rain had soaked him through and he was going to start feeling it again soon,
but at that moment he felt better than he had in weeks. He stood up on slightly shaky legs and turned around to check if
anyone had noticed his acrobatic feat. The streets were just as barren as when he'd last checked, and he almost
regretted that nobody had been witness to his amazing feat. But it was for the better.

He looked to his left now, eyeing up his final hurdle. He planned to drop from here onto the balcony and break in
through one of the entryways. He paused a second to scan the street below. All this time and he still hadn't seen
anyone. Not even headlights in the distance. It felt like he'd steeped into a void, or some sort of ghost town. This
city was never empty. Something felt heavy in his chest.

He refocused on the task at hand, he needed this. He approached the edge of the building and lined up on the balcony he
had to drop into. He breathed in and out, and on the third breath he started at a jogging pace, and only at the last
second judged how much to kick off the edge of his building. For the second time that day he felt weightless and strong.
He was flying through the rain, totally in control of his body and his goal. He could only imagine what sort of sight he
must be from the ground. His dream of cool success came barreling into his chest with the balcony floor as he half
rolled, half crashed into the floor. Quickly hauling himself up, Arthur sat crouched in the far corner were he'd landed,
trying to focus his eyes through the glass sliding door on anything inside. He was sore, but willed himself still,
blending into the shadows on the balcony to hide. Through the rain speckled glass he could make out the desk and a couch
better now, and he could see the cooking unit, and the door to the bed room. That door was half open, but he couldn't
make out anything inside. Breathing in a few times, he unfolded from the corner, and crouch walked over to the bedroom
window. Arthur paused right before he reached it, and pulled out his phone. He turned on the camera, and inched it into
view of the room.

The room was devoid of people, but what he could see left him confused and worried. The bed was clean and had been made,
and there were no clothes on the floor or mess anywhere he could make out. If Lili had been in a rush, the place
would've been a mess, but as far as he could tell there were no signs of that. Which meant either Lili was out and would
be back later, or she'd already been ready to leave. Arthur was worried now. He had to track her down, and people mostly
made mistakes when they were rushed. This person had not been rushed, and he really doubted his luck was so good that
he'd just caught her out on a smoke break.

Arthur pocketed his phone, and took out his baton. He first felt around the edges of the bedroom window, feeling for any
purchase. He felt the lip of the outer seal, and tried pulling with his numb fingers. The window didn't budge, so he
turned and crouch walked the few steps back towards the balcony door. He tried wiggling his fingers into the nearside
gap, looking to push it open from the outside. He felt it move. Arthur smiled to himself. He angled his baton into the
seam, and tried to half wedge, half crook the handle into it. It was scratching the metal **edge** but he pushed harder,
starting to lean into it. He felt it creaking as he slowly overpowered the latch and the door slid open an inch.

"Pull up at the corner there" Del said to the driver.

The driver grunted an acknowledgement and did as he was instructed. The car pulled into the lane, and they all
disembarked. In classic driver fashion, as soon as the doors shut, the cab pulled away, hoping to make it back to the
grid before their battery ran out. Del, Andrea, and Hector were left standing their on the curb, looking like the
strangest crew Del had ever commanded, and he wondered if this was a good idea. He decided it would be fine, they were
after all, going to a church. Andrea had brought up her concerns about Hector, but Del had a strange feeling about him.
Something about the guy made his skin crawl, and so he'd insisted Hector come along instead of leaving him with Rikki.
Hector might be harmless, but Rikki was clearly meant for dispatch, not baby sitting. Well maybe sort of, but not in
person. Plus he couldn't imagine putting more strain her since he'd already used up her medical supplies, and taken her
only gun. Del felt the cold metal press into his back, secure in his belt. It felt good to have a real gun again. He
felt more reassured than he'd been in a while. He eyed up Andrea, her outfit leaving nothing hidden. She had several
pouches attached across her waist, that pistol holstered on her wait, and the long sling bag across her back. He saw she
didn't have the mask anymore, and realized that it was still the same night. He met her eyes and quickly looked away,
only just realizing that he'd probably been caught staring.

"Shall we?" Andrea snapped.

"Let's go," Del said. He took the lead and went to the corner building. Normally he'd have come on foot, and probably
scaled something to get a view from above, but this operation was as ramshackle as their group. Hector shuffled after
him, and Andrea padded behind. Del tried to casually peek the corner, torn between trying too hard, and being too
casual. Ultimately he felt like he failed to gauge the situation, since Andrea and Hector simply walked past him.

"Not worth it yet" she said. "Save it for later super spy."

"Hasn't seen us yet." Hector mumbled.

Del silently cursed them both, them himself. These two barely agreed with him, and they definitely didn't know him. How
could he expect them to follow.

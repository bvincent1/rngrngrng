_Ding_ _Ding_

Arthur heard the chime.

_Ding_ _Ding_

This time he acknowledged it and reach over for his phone on the sill.

"You awake?" A chipper female voice asked.

"Wasn't asleep." He lied back to her.

"Good, 'cause I have a job for you." She responded, omitting any comments on wether or not she believed him.

Arthur sat up quickly, willing himself to be awake. He needed this job, but he didn't want to sound too desperate. He
had his pride to protect.

"Order just came in. Need you to find someone. Her name is Lili Kant."

He nodded his head to no-one in particular, trying to absorb the info into his still half asleep brain. "What does the
client need?" He asked, hopping that he wasn't making himself look like a fool.

"Just info. Need to know were she is, or were she's going. You're trailing a lead, not bringing anyone in." The female
voice carefully explained, with a hint of concern in her voice. "I'm sending the location to you now, get there quickly.
I need this."

She didn't have to say that again. He needed this probably more than she did. Without waiting for him to acknowledge she
hung up, and he pulled his phone off his face. A second later he got a notification and tapped the link. Rikki was
always nice that way. Rikki was a dispatcher, and lately he'd been getting most of his work from her. He was vaguely
aware that she worked from home and that she was mostly a tech specialist who'd doubled into finding work online for
people like him. He'd yet to meet her in person, but she seemed nice enough the way she talked to him and treated him.

Arthur watched as the app opened and the route loaded onto the map. A line connected between him and the dot where the
address was. He studied the map's directions, then pocketed his phone. He jumped into his boots on the floor at the edge
of his bed and reached for his stash of gear. Pocketing most of it, he searched for his jacket and found it on the floor
were he'd foolishly discarded it. Pulling it over his arms and smoothing the fit, he did one last check of his tiny
apartment and went to leave. He swung his hallway door open and went for the stairwell. His door was keypad operated so
he didn't have to wait for it. It also meant that he'd loose access if his funds ran out. He always kept that in mind
when leaving. He walked briskly down the hall, tails of his longer black jacket sweeping out behind him. He made good
time down the stairwell and by the time he reached the bottom floor his heart was racing from excitement and from
exertion. He needed this job, and he was an equal mix of anxious and excited. He needed this done so he could catch up
on things he'd been slacking on.

He pushed the stairwell door open and emerged into the early evening air. He started walking towards the nearest rail
station. He wasn't more than a block away from a station, so he knew he'd make good time. Emerging onto a main street
from the alley behind his building, people passed on his left and right, and Arthur did his best to ignore all of them.
Even though it was late, there was always people moving from one place to another. Arthur liked watching them from his
window, he liked imagining what reasons people had to be out and about if they weren't like him. At the doors to the
rail station he heard an chime, and he paused his rush so he could focus and listen. The prerecorded voice announced
that his train would arrive shortly. He stepped faster than he'd have liked in order to make it in time. Steps flew
past, and corners blurred as he half walked, half jogged to make it. He arrived at the **stand** and found he had a
minute to spare. He was slightly out of breath, and felt his blood pumping from the exertion. He tried to slow his
breathing, and get his heartbeat back to a relaxed speed. Slow was smooth, smooth was fast. Breathe.

Despite the late hour, the train was not empty. He had to walk towards the back to find a seat. Arthur sat heavily in a
window seat and turned to look out at the far side of the tunnel wall, blurring past him.

Arthur found he was feeling solemn about the state of things. He felt like he and everything around him was on the brink
of collapsing. Mostly he blamed the megacorps for their collective predicament. The 'corps were too busy and greedy to
notice that they were eroding the very soil they built on. Arthur saw the people pushed to the brink by policies and
monetizations resort to fighting everyone they could just to hold on. Some chose to fight the megacorps, but those
people soon found out that military contracts were a core investment, and by consequence those victims were promptly
squashed by overpowered military might. Other people, perhaps the marginally smarter ones, chose to fight each other.
Those ones made gangs, and did their best to carve out kingdoms of their own. Crime was rampant throughout the city, and
only the mega rich could afford the security necessary to avoid it. Everyone else was left to fend for themselves.

Even the weather felt hostile. Being next to ocean, the city had always been subjected to harsher rain and wind, but
lately more and more problems had cropped up. Buildings collapsing from eroded foundations and strong winds. Rain
acidity causing concrete to deteriorate faster than expected, **necessing** costly repairs.

His phone dinged again, breaking morose train of thought, and an update from Rikki popped onto the banner. 'Remember,
they just wanna know where the perp went. Don't get involved, don't cause a scene.'. As if he needed a reminder. He
pocketed his phone. A few minutes later, he got out, and ascended from the underground rail. It had started raining
slightly on his way over, and small droplets pattered on the glass windows and concrete walls just outside the station.
He pulled up his hood and collar, crossed the building threshold out into the street and started towards the address. He
walked briskly and with purpose, trying his best to project an attitude of 'don't fuck with me'. Arthur found that
attitude made up a big part of separating those whom did get into trouble and those whom did not. Despite the violence,
weapons were fairly simple. Guns were semi-common, but more often attackers would use blunt tools. Arthur himself
carried an extendable rod, preferring the low profile approach to violence. Before all this, he'd joined the military,
and to his surprise been appraised as an expert scout. His natural tendency for stealth, combined with his perfect sense
of direction had helped him get noticed early on in his training. He'd been destined for a role in the
**scouting_regiment** before things had gone sideways. Despite that, he'd always retained his skills, and as he got
closer to the block he slowed from a brisk walk into a quiet prowl. He approached the final corner, and stopped just
short. He patted his jacket pocket for the reassuring weight of the extendable baton. Once he felt it, he leaned out
from behind the corner to peer around the corner for the target building.

The street was flanked with rows of skinny midsize rises, each about 3 to 5 floors high. The street itself was bare
except for a few scraps of trash littering the steps of the various rises. There were no cars, and no people which felt
a bit odd. The rain had probably pushed everyone to leave for shelter. Thin gaps separated the buildings, that Arthur
was certain concealed tired and restless people, waiting for fairer weather, or for helpless victims to pass. He checked
the address again and confirmed that 'Lili' lived on the 3rd floor of the middle building across from him. He pulled out
his phone and messaged Rikki "Which room is hers? Perspective from the outside front of the building", and then pocketed
his phone instead of waiting for a reply. He turned around and made for the back of the building opposite his target.

He knew he didn't stand a chance of getting in the front, but he was counting on the element of surprise for this plan
he was quickly making up as he went along. Cutting through the alley he counted until he arrived at the rear of the
building opposite. He was looking to get onto the fire escape and make for the roof, but first he had to find something
to climb. Trash was haphazardly heaped against the walls, but none of it was stable enough to support his weight. He
looked around some more, and found a metal trash bin that looked passably stable. He carried it to under the ladder,
carefully flipped the bin upside down, and stood it underneath. Judging by the structural stability, he figured he'd
only get one chance at this. He carefully climbed onto the bin, taking care to place his boots near the edges were the
metal would be strongest. Once he was balanced he looked up and readied himself. He breathed in, then out, in, out. On
the next in, he tensed and pushed off with all his might. The bin buckled under the stress, and he felt one of feet slip
a bit, but it was enough. He reached out and his fingers made contact with the rusted rung. He hung on the rung while
the can clattered with a resounding bang. Turning slightly he swung his other hand up to make contact and strained his
muscles to pull himself up.

Arthur underestimated how much effort this was taking him. He pulled himself up, and remembered the endless exercises
and training he'd undergone. The screams and yells of instructors and fellow recruits flooded his memories as he muscled
up to the next bar. He made it up, and up, and before he knew it he was huffing on the metal grating of the first
landing. He took a moment to catch his breath as best he could, but he didn't want to stay longer in case that noise had
alerted someone looking to cause him trouble. He quickly ascended the grated metal steps, carefully testing his weight
in some of the more corroded sections. Before he knew it he was at the roof. It was painfully obvious he'd made it
because the rain and wind had picked up and were now battering him from what seemed like both sides.

He huddled on the roof, and slowly scooted towards the front. He pulled his jacket and hood tighter to protect himself
from the rain and wind. His jacket was an off black color and water resistant, but not water proof. He'd had it altered
and repaired a few times, extending the bottom hems, adding the hood, and adding snap-button along the front and a few
key spots in the back. All this careful attention to detail made it his most prized possession. It was silent and easy
to hide in. Both of which were vital to his profession. Even with all that, he'd still get soaked if he had to stay out
here much longer.

Once he reached the edge he pulled a monocular from his chest pocket. He carefully pulled it up to his eye, and scanned
the building across the street. It was dark now, so he could easily tell who was in and who was not based on the lights.
A careful scan of the 3rd floor told him that only one of the units was active. Their might still be people in the dark
ones, but at least they'd be slow to stir, or just simply ignore anything in favor of trying to get whatever sleep they
could. The entire thing was uninspired blocky architecture, and made with the same concrete that every construction
company used. The rooms themselves all had one unified balcony with divider walls separating each unit's alloted space.
Their were tarps covering boxes on several of the balconies, and the others had a an odd chair, or were empty. The rain
was coloring the concrete a darker grey, and combined with the wind was making a decent noise. Arthur relaxed a bit
since this meant he'd go completely unnoticed. Nothing to see here, just another pill of trash huddled against the
elements. He tried not to feel to literally about it.

Pulling the monocular away, he leaned forwards and pulled his phone out, careful not to get it wet. Hunched over his
phone, he dimmed the screen and checked for any replies from Rikki. She had responded with "3rd floor, far left". He
pocketed his phone and pulled his monocular back up to his face to better examine the target unit. The monocular didn't
have anything like a camera, night vision, or thermal imaging. Arthur had mostly used it recon, and didn't have the
money to invest in something like that. He'd once had to take pictures through it via his phone, but that was the most
technical he'd had to get. He slowly worked the focus and zoom until he could see into the unit via the balcony door and
window.

Since it was night he had a better time seeing inside the unit. Through the glass balcony door, he could make out a
small couch and a desk with a monitor on it. He couldn't see much else through the door, and he couldn't see at all
through the window, which he assumed was for the bedroom. He scooted across the roof to the other side to try and get a
better angle, but all he got was glare from an illuminated street sign down the street. it was still empty below him,
and the rain and wind was making it especially miserable. He could feel the water seeping into his clothes and he tried
to think of what to do next.

The job was to find this person, and they clearly weren't here. If there was more info Rikki would've told him. He
needed the cash, and he wouldn't get paid for showing up with nothing. Time to get resourceful. He secured the monocular
inside his jacket, and tried to figure out his next steps. He looked around and tried to see anything that he could use.
The building across from him was too tall to try his last trick with the fire escape, he'd have to spend all his time
climbing down balconies. But something like that might work on one of the neighbors. One of the neighboring building
looked like it jutted out slightly further than the target. If he could get onto its roof, he could jump off it onto the
balcony. There was only 1 floor height between the neighbor's roof, and the 3rd floor balcony. But how would he get onto
that neighboring roof?

He turned to face the neighbor straight on, and squinted to try and see past the rain whipping around. Arthur was one of
the few people left that didn't need glasses these days, as eyesight had gotten generationally poorer. Despite his above
average eyesight, he couldn't make out much. He was about to reach for the monocular, when he spotted it. Without
removing it from his pocket, he checked the time on his phone. Still good. He scuttled towards the edge of the building
he'd climbed and looked down. It was pitch black between the buildings, and he couldn't see the bottom in that gap. It
was pretty close between the two, but if he fell, that'd be it for him. Arthur backed up from the edge and squared up to
his target. He took a few breaths, and wiped his hands on the insides of his jacket to try and dry them off. They felt
clammy and slick. He'd be pushing his luck with this one. In three steps, he closed the gap and leapt.

Arthur felt weightless in the air, like he'd be able to jump across the whole street if he had tried. His arms were up
and reaching. He'd angled his approach and used the balustrade as a boost to do this. That trick had gained him the
extra feet he needed to make this work. All too quickly his outstretched hands slapped against the cold plastic of the
cabling, and he grabbed hold with all his might. He quickly swung his other arm to grab hold as well. He felt his
shoulder twinge, and he knew he should have stretched before all this.

Now he was hanging, swinging even, on some cabling suspended between the two buildings. He had guessed that the cable
could take his weight, but it had been a gamble. He hung there, suspended between two buildings, 4 stories up, soaking
wet, and questioning if the cable would hold his weight the whole time, or would detach part way through his highwire
act. Good thing the streets were empty, because between the cable twanging tight all of a sudden and the business sign
backlighting him someone would have surely noticed. He didn't have to worry about looking down, because it took his full
concentration to grab the cable. Hand over hand, he climbed forwards. He was only about halfway before he found a flaw
in his plan. The cable he was climbing across, like some playground equipment from his childhood, was sagging. He didn't
know what exactly it's purpose was, but clearly the installation engineer had not prepared it to support the weight of a
full grown man. Arthur knew it was too late to back down, so he kipped up and pulled his legs up onto the cable. Taking
the weight off his arms, left him more strength to focus on his grip. His willpower was strong, and that what mattered.
He pulled instead of swung now, and did his best to ignore the growing pain in his shoulder and the cold seeping into
every part of his body. This maneuver had opened him up to the elements on a whole new scale. His jacket was hanging off
him by the shoulders, and the rain was hammering his face. His hands would go numb soon, and when that happened, he
would be done for.

Hand over numbing hand, Arthur pulled himself along the cable until he reached the opposite building. He wedged his
shoulder right up against the concrete and reached up onto the roof. The concrete was even colder than the plastic and
he struggled to find purchase. Pulling himself overtop the cable, he could now see the roof and use his other hand to
drag himself over the lip, and onto the flat, graveled roof. He hauled himself into a crouched position on his knees.
His chest was heaving from the effort and his lungs ached. Gravel stung his hands and knees and clung to him where he'd
scraped it. The cold was still their but it had mixed with the warmth of exertion. Quickly, his lungs stopped aching,
and his breathing came under control. The rain had soaked him through and he was going to start feeling it again soon,
but at that moment he felt better than he had in weeks. He stood up on slightly shaky legs and turned around to check if
anyone had noticed his acrobatic feat. The streets were just as barren as when he'd last checked, and he almost
regretted that nobody had been witness to his amazing feat. But it was for the better.

He looked to his left now, eyeing up his final hurdle. He planned to drop from here onto the balcony and break in
through one of the entryways. He paused a second to scan the street below. All this time and he still hadn't seen
anyone. Not even headlights in the distance. It felt like he'd steeped into a void, or some sort of ghost town. This
city was never empty. Something felt heavy in his chest.

He refocused on the task at hand, he needed this. He approached the edge of the building and lined up on the balcony he
had to drop into. He breathed in and out, and on the third breath he started at a jogging pace, and only at the last
second judged how much to kick off the edge of his building. For the second time that day he felt weightless and strong.
He was flying through the rain, totally in control of his body and his goal. He could only imagine what sort of sight he
must be from the ground. His dream of cool success came barreling into his chest with the balcony floor as he half
rolled, half crashed into the floor. Quickly hauling himself up, Arthur sat crouched in the far corner were he'd landed,
trying to focus his eyes through the glass sliding door on anything inside. He was sore, but willed himself still,
blending into the shadows on the balcony to hide. Through the rain speckled glass he could make out the desk and a couch
better now, and he could see the cooking unit, and the door to the bed room. That door was half open, but he couldn't
make out anything inside. Breathing in a few times, he unfolded from the corner, and crouch walked over to the bedroom
window. Arthur paused right before he reached it, and pulled out his phone. He turned on the camera, and inched it into
view of the room.

The room was devoid of people, but what he could see left him confused and worried. The bed was clean and had been made,
and there were no clothes on the floor or mess anywhere he could make out. If Lili had been in a rush, the place
would've been a mess, but as far as he could tell there were no signs of that. Which meant either Lili was out and would
be back later, or she'd already been ready to leave. Arthur was worried now. He had to track her down, and people mostly
made mistakes when they were rushed. This person had not been rushed, and he really doubted his luck was so good that
he'd just caught her out on a smoke break.

Arthur pocketed his phone, and took out his baton. He first felt around the edges of the bedroom window, feeling for any
purchase. He felt the lip of the outer seal, and tried pulling with his numb fingers. The window didn't budge, so he
turned and crouch walked the few steps back towards the balcony door. He tried wiggling his fingers into the nearside
gap, looking to push it open from the outside. He felt it move. Arthur smiled to himself. He angled his baton into the
seam, and tried to half wedge, half crook the handle into it. It was scratching the metal **edge** but he pushed harder,
starting to lean into it. He felt it creaking as he slowly overpowered the latch and the door groaned open an inch. Now
he fully inserted the baton into the gap and wedged it to lever open the door the rest of the way. It let out one final
groan and then a satisfying pop as the metal latch fully snapped and the door rolled open.

He crouch walked into the room, dripping rainwater onto the clean floor. Without turning he slide the door shut behind
him. It wouldn't shut all the way, but it was good enough. He stood there a moment, tensed. He was pretty sure the place
was empty, but it could be a trap, or he could have just been wrong. He strained his hearing to try and decipher
anything that would indicate danger, but all he could here was the soft tapping of rain on glass. He stood up to his
full height, and rolled his sore shoulders, taking a moment to relax and ready himself at the same time. The room was
dark and quiet, and now that he was standing he could see that it was neat and tidy. He was by far the messiest thing in
the room, and he was slowly spreading a puddle of water onto the floor. He pulled a mat over and covered the small mess
he'd made, walked over to the bed room. Arthur held his baton in front of him, low but ready, in case and turned into
the bedroom. It was as clear os the rest of the apartment. He went and checked the bathroom, and saw that while it had
signs of use, it was also tidy and neat. As far of decoration went, the apartment had a double mattress with plain
sheets, some basic storage of fake wood cabinets, a cloth couch, and a desk with a desktop plugged in. He went through
all the drawers and shelves, finding nothing out of place, and nothing obviously missing. It was like this "Lili" had
either stepped out this morning and never returned, or she'd had everything set up and just abandoned her life here. He
sat on the couch, which faced towards the desk and tried to think. Then he had an idea.

He pulled out his phone and tapped on Rikki's contact icon. A soft dialing tone came from his phone and he put it to his
ear, bracing for the emotional damage this was going to do to him.

_Click_

"I need your help" Arthur said, with his eyes closed, his face scrunched up in self disgust, and his gut tightening in
apprehension.

"More than you know." Rikki snapped back, the sarcasm dripping from her tone. "I take it she's not there."

"No. The place is empty and there's not much to go on. But there's a desktop here" Arthur paused for a second. "I figure
maybe you could help with that?" He paused for what felt like an eternity. He didn't actually know if she could help
him, but he knew she was good with computers and software. Maybe she had a solution.

"Is it passw- actually dont answer that." She cut herself off mid statement. "Put me on speaker, and plug me into a
port."

Arthur did as he was told, and fumbled out a cable to connect his phone to the computer.

"Wait" Rikki said over the speakerphone.

Arthur paused, one end of the cable connected to his phone, the other inches from connecting to the machine.

"Did you already plug in the phone?" She asked.

"No"

"Good, turn off the desktop first, then plug me in, then find the keyboard, turn it on, and then hold down the delete
key." She paused. "Got all that?"

Arthur paused a second, he was identifying th delete key on the keyboard, even though he'd used one a million times
before. After a second he replied "Got it. I'll let you know when I turn it on"

"Thanks" the woman on the speaker. Then a second later "Wait!".

Arthur's heart rate was spiking from all this constant back and forth. "I'm waiting" He replied, trying to keep his tone
calm and cool.

"Remember that app I had you install forever ago? Turn it on, and keep it running before you turn the computer on."
Rikki's voice had a shakiness to it. She was certainly strained to setup whatever she was planning, and having to manage
him and her own stuff was clearly a stretch of her skills.

"Got it." With everything prepped he let out a breath he didn't know he'd been holding. "I'm ready on my end, you good?"

"Do it" Rikki responded, her voice icy and focused.

Arthur power cycled the machine, and did as he was instructed. He was looking a screen, and then it turned blue with a
bunch of text and some options.

"Let go of the keyboard, and select boot options." Rikki's voice came from the phone.

Arthur did as he was told and carefully inspected the options on the monitor. He found one labeled "Boot options" and
clicked it.

"You'll need to use the keyboard" Rikki replied before he could even ask.

Arthur was getting frustrated with this, but he did as he told. A second later Rikki gave him more instructions, and
after a couple minutes of back and forth troubleshooting they made progress. Now the screen was flashing with all sorts
of text and info. Arthur could here loud clacking over the call. Rikki was typing faster than he could even dream, and
she was clearly focused. He waited for her inevitable gloating to start.

"So I've found something. But I can't read it." Rikki started, "you see most of the stuff on here is unencrypted, and
useless. But there's a drive that I can't read. That's probably important. I'm gonna need you to get that and bring it
to me. I can't copy it from here." Rikki said.

She sounded worn out, despite not actually having done anything nearly as strenuous as what he'd done. Arthur had pulled
up a chair and sat quietly while this had gone down. Much to his surprise Rikki's searching had taken longer than it had
to hack in. He was about to respond to her when he paused. His heart was suddenly beating too loud, and he willed his
ears to ignore it. He heard scratching coming from the door. He acted faster than he could talk. He ripped his phone
from the connection, and clenched his first around it in a desperate struggle to power it off without properly finding
the button. He heard a faint squeak and then nothing from his phone, and the monitor flashed a bunch of corrupted
letters, then died. He dived behind the far end of the couch just as the door opened, spilling light into the room.
Arthur desperately tucked himself behind the arm of the couch and thanked god that he'd kept his hood on.

From his position behind the arm of the couch, he was facing towards the glass door of the balcony. In the reflection he
could see a figure standing in the brightly lit doorway. They were dressed in loose, but not obstructive black clothing.
From what he could tell they had a half mask covering the bottom of their face and some sort of googles over their eyes.
His own reflection didn't show any meaningful shape and instead made him look like a dark pile. He was fixed in place,
knowing full well that any movement would give him away. The figure stepped inside, and closed the door without looking.
The faint click and snap told him they'd locked it behind them. The figure surveyed the room from a standstill and
paused looking at the doorway to the bedroom. They raised one arm up, and leveled the other underneath it, a small shape
in their hand. Arthur figured it was a gun of some sort, but he couldn't recognize the type outright from the
reflection. One careful step after the other, the figure moved towards the bedroom door. They held a low stance, ready
for a fight. Experienced. Arthur was suddenly very aware of the mess he'd made on the way in. As the figure stepped
closer and closer, he lost his view in the reflection of the glass balcony door. Arthur had to wait until he was sure
the figure wouldn't see him move. It was agony, but he forced himself to wait , counting the seconds in his head. At the
bottom of his count he silently shifted from the end of the couch to the front, almost crawling so the figure wouldn't
be able to see him.

To his credit, he was as silent as a shadow. He made it all the way to the other end of the couch and peaked around the
corner. From his new point of view he saw the figure had their back turned towards him. From here he could see that they
were smaller than him. He decided that he could take them in hand to hand. He ducked back behind the couch as the figure
swept back and forth, clearing the bedroom. Arthur didn't recognize the weapon, but he knew his time was running out. It
didn't really matter if it was less than lethal or not, either way that'd be the end for him. He looked at the door, and
tried to imagine if he still had enough time to unlock it and escape into the hallway. He was halfway through his mental
preparation, when he heard a click from the bedroom. Footsteps followed, quiet, but not silent. The footsteps were
crossing back out into the living room, but they paused. It was only a few seconds, but to Arthur it felt like an
eternity. He knew it was about to be the moment. The moment when you committed to violence, to confrontation. The moment
where you had to embrace the darker side, and block out everything else. His pulse quickened as adrenalin flooded his
veins. His ears started ringing from the sudden pressure change, and he suddenly felt like he had to pant to breath. He
sucked in a breath, and sprung.

In the time since he'd last looked, the other intruder had turned to inspect the balcony door. They had clearly noticed
the small mess he'd made, and the crack in the door. He figured that distraction was to his advantage. They were sideway
from where he'd been hiding, and had dropped their arms to their sides. The click he'd heard had been their sidearm, yet
another boon in his favor. He pulled his arm back to make a blow, intending to swing his baton. With an extra flick of
his wrist he extended it to it's full length and swung with all he had at their head. He heard a half grunt of surprise,
and then saw to his horror ans they dropped lower and sprung towards him. They both collided mid-air and fell in heap on
the floor. His baton arm was pinned, but he jabbed with his free hand into their side, he landed one blow and they let
out another grunt, but followed up with a punch to his chest which pushed the air out from his lungs. Before he could
breath they rolled over him with his baton arm still held and wrenched his wrist. He couldn't help but yelp in pain and
drop his weapon. He couldn't even double over anymore with the other person laying on top over him, but he managed to
suck in a breath and grab them in a bear hug. He swung his legs up and managed to push off the couch, flipping over so
he was on top. It only half worked as the other had slipped out midway through and had rolled into a crouched position
at the corner of the couch. He had ripped the goggles off and saw a pair of piercing dark eyes glaring at him. They
belonged to a woman and she didn't hold back anymore. She sprung up at him and delivered a flurry of kicks to his sides.
He managed to block some of them, but she landed a few to his already sore sides and shoulders. He backed off and
crashed into a shelf, knocking plates and belongings onto the floor in a crescendo of noise and thumps. Back against she
swung again aiming for his head. He managed to sidestep her, and instead shoved her with all his strength into the
shelf. She let out a grunt and he a huff as he drove all the wind from her lungs. He took the chance to back off, and
without trying to seem desperate, he deigned to try a different tactic.

"Lili, I'm here to help you." he said, breathing hard and holding up a weak hand in front of him. His wrist was
throbbing and pain was shotting up his sides where she'd landed her kicks. She paused for a second, and he thought she
even caulked her head to the side, pondering what he'd just said. Before he could keep talking, she reached towards her
side and went to pull her sidearm. Arthur cursed his bad planning, and his bad judgement. This woman was better than him
in every way. She was better equipped, and better trained. He was outclassed and he knew it. She probably knew it too.
He leapt again at her, intending to pin her arms so she couldn't draw on him. She saw him leap again, and went to block
him but she slipped. He tumbled into her and missed the grab. She was on the floor and he was only managed to grab her
arm. In this new position, she had pinned her own arm and couldn't draw on him. He used his bigger size to pin her and
felt her land blow after blow with her free arm. He braced himself against it and dug his boots into the floor to hold
her pinned against the floor and the wall. He gritted his teeth and put all he could into keeping her pinned. After what
felt like forever he felt her loosen up a fraction, and he heard her yell at him.

"I'm not Lili you asshole."

He almost loosened up, but he kept digging he boots into the floor, and kept shoving her into the corner.

"Killing me wont get you paid, and I can't exactly claim your her either. So lets just go our separate ways. Clearly
she's long gone." She said, straining under his pressure, but more controlled than last time.

Arthur let up a fraction, but didn't loosen his grip on her arm. "I'm not here to kill her, I'm trying to find her" he
said. He was about to keep going when he was thrown up against the wall in a heap beside the woman. It was a tangle of
arms and legs as the woman struggled to struggle her arms free, and leverage her legs out from under him. Arthur
meanwhile was now facing the door and saw two armed figures entering a blown out doorway. It registered to him a second
later that the door had been breached and had crashed into the glass balcony door. He'd been thrown by the pressure wave
and now he had new problems. The two figures were heavily armed and had begun sweeping the room in an aggressive
fashion. The woman, partially underneath him finally freed her gun and raised it above her head and fire off shots in
the direction of the newest intruders. They immediately ducked, fired back with high aim, and retreated to the hallway
beyond. It took a near miss to break the stupor that had come over him, and he immediately dove into action. He crawled
forward and roughly tipped the couch into a form of visual cover. The woman dove after him, taking cover behind the
makeshift barrier, while leveling her pistol high over her head to keep up a steady barrage.

Arthur dropped into a prone position, knowing full well that any return fire would shred the couch they'd taken refuge
behind. To her credit the woman had emptied her magazine and slotted in a new one with alarming speed and precision. "We
need to get out of here!" he yelled over the barrage.

"How about you get your gun out and help me instead?" the woman said, not even pausing her staccato of suppressive
shots. "That was the only entrypoint!!" She screamed, clearly about to loose it on either him, or the assailants outside
the door.

Her gun clicked empty and she ducked, then lay prone on the floor. A split second later return fire sounded. Bullets and
couch material exploded out inches above them. Arthur felt like he'd never been so close to live fire in his life and
was sure that any second one the rounds would hit him. he forced himself to look away from the impending death, and
towards his feet where the shattered balcony was. He needed to make it out there and then he could escape roughly the
same was he came in. Maybe this new friend of his would even make it if she followed his lead. He just needed a
distraction. He glanced around and saw only destruction and chaos. With a sickening feeling he reached into his chest
pocket and produced his monocular. He rolled onto his back, and with his free hand patted the woman on her should, held
a single finger to his mouth, and then yelled at the top of his lungs. "Grenade out!!"

A split second later he lobbed the tubular object from a prone position over the couch and beyond. He never knew where
it landed. He never got the chance to find out later. All he knew was a split second later the firing paused, and he
thought he could make out muffled shouting. What he did know is that it was now over never. He rolled to his feet and
sprung into what remained of the glass door. He tucked his head behind his arm and shoulder and crashed through it,
landing in a shower of wet glass on the hard and cold concrete. The woman was half a second behind him, and got a much
better deal because of it. She grabbed him by the good shoulder and pulled him up into cover behind the concrete wall
separating the door and the bedroom window.

"Now what?!" she yelled at him.

The rain was coming down hard now, and her hair was getting soaked. Arthur couldn't help but notice her eyes again, dark
and scared above the mask covering her mouth and nose. He turned to face out, calling back to her as he built up speed.
"Now we jump for it!" he yelled, leaping off the balcony railing.

If he hadn't have know it was there, he'd have never sen the cable suspended between the neighboring buildings. It
probably looked like he had just chosen to leap off a three story building rather than face the heavily armed assault
force that had bore down on them. Arthur really would've preferred a three story fall to being riddled with bullets, but
he would've probably paused for a second longer before committing to a last ditch move such as that.

This leap was much more frantic and desperate than his previous time. His angle had been much more aggressive since he
didn't want to leave anything to chance. The cable caught him across his chest and he swung back and forth laterally
with his left arm over it a few times. He was about to swing his legs up and begin his **clamber** to freedom when he
felt the cable violently shake and a grunt from next to him.

He turned in horror to see the woman had leapt in front of him. She had aimed past him, further towards the center, and
had therefore grabbed on by her elbow instead her armpit like him. He had honestly expected her to take longer to make
up her mind, and therefore give him a chance to clamber further across. Instead they were now both next to each other,
but with her hanging lower than him. Arthur's already adrenalin fired brain was struggling to think of what to do next,
when he suddenly dropped a few feet. He gripped the cable harder than he'd gripped anything in his life. The woman let
out a small scream, but held on she turned just her head to face him, the fear and anger clear in her eyes. That was all
he could see above below the rain slick hair, and the soaking mask which had slipped to under her nose. He was about to
say something when he dropped another few feet. Then he heard a a series of pops, and a single deafening snap. Over all
the noise of the rain, and surely gunfire the snap rang clearest. His heart leapt into his throat long before the
gravity got hold of him. Now it was his turn to yell, and the woman he was with screamed too. They fell together for
what seemed like an eternity. Arthur couldn't see anything in front of him because the woman was blocking his view. Soon
the line went tight and he was jerked forward, barely able to hold on. The cable was freezing and slick with rain. His
stomach lurched and he knew that the ground was going to come up any moment now. Together they were rotating on the
cable and at the last moment he caught a split second view of the opposite building coming into view. He didn't have
time to brace or cushion the blow and he slammed full tilt into the hard concrete.

He felt a crunch and a bang, and suddenly he opened his eyes to see he was on the ground in a heap. He was sitting on
his ass, in the cold and wet with the cable next to him in a pile. He blinked away the rain and noticed that his head
was ringing and that he was in incredible pain. He opened his mouth but nothing came out, just a hollow noise from his
chest. The woman was there, in front of him, standing. She seemed to have faired much better than he had, and he
desperately wanted to ask her for help. He couldn't form any words but he saw a look of confusion and anger in her face.
He felt cold and tired, and he knew he was about to pass out. He tried to lift an arm to grab her, to steady himself,
but he felt himself pitch forward onto the sidewalk. He lay there an instant, hoping to get help, unsure what would
happen to him. He closed his eyes and the world faded away.

description: Meet Hector, Hector meets Peter

*Crack*

Hector's world slowly came back into focus. Consciousness leaked back into his body. It started in his hands and feet, and slowly moved up into his arms, legs, and shoulders. Eventually it reached his head. It slowly self assessed and confirmed he was alive and mostly intact.

*Crack*

Hector slowly opened his eyes and squinted as the light seeped in. His vision was blurry and filled with spots. He slowly tried to look around without moving, trying to identify the source of the noise that roused him from his drug induced unconsciousness.

*Crack*

He was in the orange zone, so it was definitely life threatening. Everything in this zone was a threat. Hector was no fool, but he was an addict. The stuff he needed, the life he lived depended on this zone. He was an addict who wasn't used up yet. He knew the next score would set him up. He just needed to last out until then.

*Crack*

The sound wasn't moving, so whatever it was they didn't know he was here. It probably helped that he'd covered himself in cardboard and some random garbage trying to keep warm overnight. He was in an industrial yard, somewhere near the sea wall of the orange zone.

The orange zone was one three zones, Green, Orange, and Red, coded by livability. The orange zone was a collection of ruins, and shanty-growth that barely supported life. Buildings that were considered dangerous and unusable sat scattered throughout, supported by haphazard construction and cannibalistic scavenging from other ruins and abandoned shanty work. Most of the original buildings still had scars from the war that scorched this town from decades past. Explosions, bullets, and fighting had destroyed and crippled the southern bay of the city. But no-one had come back after the war. While the green zone had been rebuilt, the other zones had been left behind. Ugly scars on the city that nobody cared about, or wanted to deal with. It was far easier to build new, or start where their was already nothing standing than to venture out into a desolate war zone to find something livable. And it was still a war zone. People were still finding equipment, weapons, and bombs scattered throughout, and people were still fighting over the scraps both old an new. That's were Hector made his living, but not by choice. He was a thief, a dealer, and a fighter when necessary. He didn't want to be here, and he hated the condition that it left him in day after day, but it was either struggle or die. He didn't have it in him to die. When he got low he turned to drugs, and lately he'd been low often. But his luck would change, he knew it. The next big score was out there. All he needed to do was find it.

He'd curled up in the corner where a chain-link fence met a wall. The fencing had slats for privacy that had long since degraded into mere suggestions. The other side was a corrugated metal wall that had rusted into oblivion. It had been a complete building at one point, but it was collapsed and exposing metal beams like ribs on a carcass. Rust seeped out into his corner, and made it look even more convincing with it's dark red and black stains on his clothes and cardboard. The wind caused the metal to groan and whistle, as if the building hadn't finished dying yet despite it's exposed organs and hemorrhaging blood. Between the rust, and scavenging, Hector figured it didn't have long before it collapsed into itself and finally died. Hector slowly propped up against the corrugated wall to try and see past the heaps, further into the yard. The yard was only marginally better. The gravel had long since been turned to mud, and garbage was pilled everywhere. Hector has been upwind of most of it, but the damp smell of rot, and rust was strongly present here. His head started to ache and the groaning metal corpse he was sitting against was only hurrying what was going to be a crippling withdrawal migraine. He slowly moved and pushed the damp cardboard off himself. Trying to be as delicate as possible so that whomever else was here they would not hear him.

*Crunch*

This one had been more delayed. He rubbed his temple with one dirty hand and massaged some feeling back into his shoulder with the other. The pain slowly hit him as the drugs continued to wear off. He was coming down from his latest high, and he knew it wouldn't be good. Propping himself more up, slowly, and carefully he tried to see more. It has come from across the yard, but he couldn't see past all the other garbage and detritus that was scattered about. He had only made it to a half sitting position, and so he was barely higher than some of the heaps, but he strained his sore eyes to see what had caused the noise. There was crunching and movement across from some of the boxes. Hector could hear it, but he still couldn't see anything. He was conflicted between slumping down to try and blend with the garbage surrounding him, or crawling towards the noise to try and assess what it was. He chose to investigate.

As he bent over and started crawling on all fours, every movement brought more protests from his sore and spent muscles. His body protested like it had run a marathon while he was passed out, but he ignored it.
Better to know now than later. Slowly he crawled towards where the crunching sound had been coming from. His fingers were covered in lumpy mud and specks of garbage. His clothes were caked in it, and every time he moved parts either fell off, or stuck anew. He winced at the noises coming from him, horrified that he was making more noise that whatever else was in the yard. He only just noticed that chest was pounding, and it only compounded his perception of the noises he was making. But he had to know. He got closer. He knew what it was. His brain had put it together faster than his consciousness. Only one thing made that kind of noise.

On all fours, he made it to cover, and inched towards the side opposite to where the noises where coming from. Inching towards the corner, he didn't want to be seen witnessing this, but he still wanted to know who was involved. At the corner he found more boxes parked at an angle, such that there was a slit he could look through. He squinted his eyes against the harsh glare that was coming off some metal pipes across the yard until he could just make out some figures. A man had a metal pipe and was wielding it like a bat in two hands. Three men other stood around watching, or looking back towards the entrance of the yard. The pipe was slick with gore and the one wielding it had spatters of blood all over himself. None of them seemed to care. Hector saw the mess in the middle. Whatever, or whoever it was wasn't getting up anytime soon. A gurgling noise was coming from the heap of gore in the center. Wet and rhythmic, almost in time with the other noises.

*Crunch*

The one with the pipe swung again. Making the horrible noise as the pipe cracked into the prone figure on the muddy ground. Hector knew the person was dead. They'd clearly messed with the wrong gang, and they were now paying the price. He was about to leave when he heard someone speak up.


**checkpoint

"...'nough" Said a man standing, and watching.
"...thought we wanted to send a message" said the one with the pipe in a thuggish and brash accent.
"Message sent. Now come on, we're supposed to collect more holdings today" replied the standing man again.
"Fine" said the man with pipe, and he nonchalantly tossed it into the air. It flipped end over end and bounced off the body one last time with loud thump-clack of metal and bone.

They all started walking across the yard towards the entrance the other two had been watching. None of them turned or checked behind them as they turned the corner and left for the street in front of the building. The last one, the one who had given the merciless beating, had gore splattered up from his boots to his knees. With them all gone, Hector slowly shuffled around the boxes to get a look at the body in the middle of the yard. He slowly stood up from his bent position, and his back reminded him that he had been passed out without consulting it how best to lay down. He let out an involuntary groan as he straitened up. He stopped, just  paranoid enough to believe that he wasn't alone. Nothing happened, and he moved closer to the body.

Whoever they were, there would be no identifying the body from facial matches. The whole face had been caved in, and the chest was broken open to reveal ribs, and guts. Blood slowly seeped out through the back of the corpse, and stained the mud an even dirtier color. Their clothes were a faded crimson color, and had been stained even darker from the blood. There was a lot of blood. Hector looked away and then back at the corpse. He almost didn't notice the strangeness of the outfit. The corpse was wearing some sort of smock. It had a hood that had folded under it's skull, but the robes themselves were still visible across the bodies' sides and legs.

Hector didn't know what to make of the outfit, but he decided to leave before anyone else came his way. He'd only stopped for a minute, and he didn't trust this place. This city had eyes everywhere. He pulled up his filthy hood, and wiped off some dirt from his jacket as he tried to look presentable. At least for an addict.
Making his way to the gate, he slowly peered to his right, leaning out from behind the building to see if the gangsters were still in view. His paranoia was well founded. Not only did he witness them brutally murder someone beyond recognition, but he probably owed them money as well.
Hector was not well off in this city. He conned, and stole everything he had and had made a lot of enemies over the years. He'd ripped off his fair share of gangsters, and more than once had to make a quick getaway from them.

He couldn't see anyone, and so he made to his left, opposite from the gangsters. While they were headed the same way he wanted to go, he couldn't just follow them out. That'd be a surefire way to get caught. He figured he'd just cut through the next yard, and then appear somewhere in front of them, headed the same way. He'd crossed the gaps between buildings and was about to turn into another abandoned yard when he heard a yell from behind him. He turned his head, and to his horror the gore covered one had appeared around the far corner. Hector locked eyes with him for a split second, and then turned to run.

He let out another groan as he forced his already protesting body to move in ways it did not intend to. Running, he grabbed the corner of the building and swung himself around, and slammed half tilt into a fence. He had miss-judged the gate and slammed into the fence instead. He clumsily fell backwards onto his ass. He sat up and turned to see if his pursuer had made any progress. The man had. The man, covered in gore up to his knees was half way done passing the building Hector had avoided and was closing fast. Suddenly adrenalin pumped into Hector's veins and he pushed his body into overdrive. He stood up and ran towards the open gate, not five meters from him. This time he swung around the gate correctly, and kept moving full tilt into the partially abandoned yard. He ran around a pile of big metal pipes and leapt over some scattered woden pallets. He ran, headed for the fence at the back. He fully intended to get over it no matter what the physical cost. Hector had learned long ago, that nothing could be worse than getting caught. Passing fallen boxes at a blur, he quickly turned his head to see how he was doing. The man was further behind than he had hoped, but he was still coming. Before he could straighten his neck, Hector once again crashed into a fence. This time he grabbed hold with his fingers and managed to stay upright. He looked left and right to try and find some way out. The fence was taller than him, and had barbs at the top facing outwards. Off to his left Hector saw a stack of pipes and made for them. Slipped on some mud, and let out a yelp as he did. He was going to get out, he just had to run. His lum=ngs sucked in air, and he could only hear his heart pumping in his ears. All his problems were in front of him, and they started with getting on this pile of pipes. He grabbed a support strap and pulled himself up onto the first pipe. His feet scrapped on the metal and his shins cracked. He pulled with all his might and hoisted himself up. Along the strap. He saw the man was closing quickly and he knew that he was moments from being grabbed. The man let out a yell, probably as much to draw the other murders, as to throw Hector off his balance. Hector pulled himself up again, and flung his body with all his might off the top of the triangularly stacked pipes. He felt like he was soaring over through the air and could only imagine the look on his pursuers faces as he cleared the fence. He didn't fully clear the fence. His pant leg caught the barbs and be was jerked to the right as the barbs dug into his leg.

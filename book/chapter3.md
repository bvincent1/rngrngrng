description: Meet Hector, Hector meets Peter

Hector's world slowly came back into focus. Consciousness leaked back into his body. It started in his hands and feet, and slowly moved up into his arms, legs, and shoulders. Eventually it reached his head. His consciousness did a quick self assessment and reassured itself that he wasn't dead, or badly hurt. It did however tell him that he was sore and that he needed to stretch.
Hector slowly opened his eyes and winced at the light that seeped in. His vision was blurry and filled with spots. Wincing, he slowly moved his legs and rolled over onto his back, letting his eyes slowly adjust to the light through half closed lids. He rubbed his temple with one dirty hand and massaged some feeling back into his shoulder with the other. Sounds came to him slowly, and he opened his eyes again to try and take stock of his surroundings.
He was somewhere's near the sea-wall. He could smell the stale sea water and the wet concrete. As he looked around some more he saw that he was crammed up against a building he didn't recognize, but assumed was a warehouse. The siding had long since rusted, and if he focused he could hear it groan ever so slightly in the wind. It was probably abandoned, and he was probably alone. The pain slowly hit him as the drugs continued to wear off. He was coming down from his latest high, and he knew it wouldn't be good. The groaning made his head ache even more. Propping himself up slowly, carefully, he tried to rest another minute before the pain overtook him. He slowly pushed himself up into a seating position, trying to keep himself level and stable. He was in a corner at the back of a work yard, and trying to prop himself up against the building. There was some garbage in his crushed cardboard, long since melted into indistinguishable lumps, slimy paper that had moulded into thin specks along his boots and pant legs. before he finished his long and arduous process, he heard a crash of fence and metal. He knew he wasn't alone anymore.
Out of habit he stopped moving and looked around for the source of the noise. It has come from across the yard, but he couldn't see past all the other garbage and detritus that was scattered about. He had only made it to a half sitting position, and so he was barely higher than some of the boxes, but he strained his sore eyes to see what had caused the noise. There has crunching and movement across from some of the boxes. Hector could hear it, but he still couldn't see anything. He was conflicted between slumping down to try and blend with the garbage surrounding him, or crawling towards the noise to try and assess what it was. He chose to crawl.
As he bent over and started crawling, every movement brought more protests from his sore and spent muscles. His body protested like it had run a marathon while he was passed out, but he ignored it.
Better to know now than later.
Crunch. Slowly he crawled towards the crunching sound. His fingers covered in lumpy mud and specks of garbage. His clothes were caked in it, and every time he moved parts either fell off, or stuck anew. He winced with the noise, horrified that he was making more noise that whatever else was in the yard. But he had to know. Crunch. As he got closer, he could ascertain that the crunching was rhythmic, and that there was small noises between strokes. He knew what it was, but he wanted to know why. Crunch. On all fours, he made it to cover, and inched towards the side opposite to where the noises where coming from. He didn't want to be seen witnessing this, but he still wanted to know who was involved. Crunch. Around the corner he found more boxes parked at an angle, such that there was a slit he could look through. He squinted his eyes against the harsh glare that was coming off some metal pipes across the yard. Until he could just make out some figures. Crunch. A man had a metal pipe and was wielding it like a bat in 2 hands. 3 men other stood around watching, or looking back towards the entrance of the yard. The pipe was slick with gore. and the one wielding it had spatters of blood all over himself. None of them seemed to care. Hector saw the mess in the middle. Whatever, or whoever it was wasn't getting up anytime soon. A gurgling noise was coming from the heap of gore in the center. Wet and rhythmic, almost in time with the other noises. Crunch. The one with the pipe swung again. Making the horrible noise as the pipe cracked into the prone figure on the muddy ground. Hector knew the person was dead. They'd clearly messed with the wrong gang, and where now paying the price. He was about to leave when he heard someone speak up.
"...'nough" Said a man standing, and watching.
"...thought we wanted to send a message" said the one with the pipe in a thuggish and brash accent.
"Message sent. Now come on, we're supposed to collect more holdings today" replied the standing man again.
"Fine" said the man with pipe, and he nonchalantly tossed it into the air. It arcked and landed onto the body with loud thump-clack of metal and bone.
They all started walking across the yard towards the entrance the other 2 had been watching. None of them turned or checked behind them as they turned the corner and left for the street in front of the building. Hector saw the last one to leave was covered in blood, and had gore splattered up from his boots to his knees. With them all gone, Hector slowly shuffled around the boxes to get a look at the body in the middle of the yard. He slowly stood up from his bent position, and his back reminded him that he had been passed out without consulting it how best to lay down. Without the cover in his way could clearly see the body now, abd let out an involuntary groan as he stood up all the way.

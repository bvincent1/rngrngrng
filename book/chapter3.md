description: Meet Hector, Hector meets Peter
---


Hector's world slowly came back into focus. Consciousness leaked back into his body. It started in his hands and feet, and slowly moved up into his arms, legs, and shoulders. Eventually it reached his head. It slowly self assessed and confirmed he was alive and mostly intact. Hector slowly opened his eyes and squinted as the light seeped in. His vision was blurry and filled with spots. While his world slowly came into focus, he guessed it was mid morning.

He'd curled up in a corner where a chain-link fence met a wall. The fencing had slats for privacy, but those had long since degraded into mere suggestions. The other side was a corrugated metal wall that had rusted into a husk of it's former glory. It had been a complete building at one point, but it had collapsed and the exposed metal beams now looked like ribs on a carcass. Rust seeped out into his corner, and made the metaphor look even more convincing with it's dark red and black stains on his clothes and the trash he'd slept on. The wind caused the metal to groan and whistle, as if the building hadn't finished dying yet despite it's exposed organs and hemorrhaging blood. Between the rust, and scavenging, Hector figured it didn't have long before it collapsed into itself and finally died. Hector slowly propped up against the corrugated wall to try and see past the heaps, further into the yard. The yard was only marginally better. The gravel had long since been turned to mud, and garbage was pilled everywhere. Hector has been upwind of most of it, but the damp smell of rot, and rust was still present. His head started to ache and the groaning metal corpse he was sitting against was only accelerating what was going to be a crippling withdrawal migraine. He slowly moved and pushed off his makeshift cover of damp cardboard. He slowly rolled onto his back, and stretched his legs. He silently thanked himself for passing out in a position that hadn't left him completely crippled with soreness.

He slowly pushed himself up into a sitting position against the wall. His grimy clothes helped him slide up the wall rather than scrub it, and he sat upright for a minute. Slowly he tried to focus is spinning mind. The drugs always wore off in stages but this stage had been more delayed. He rubbed his temple with one dirty hand and then massaged some feeling back into his shoulder with the other. The pain slowly hit him as the drugs continued to wear off. He was coming down from his latest high, and he knew it wouldn't be good. Propping himself up some more, ever so slowly, and with careful movements he tried to see more of the yard. He didn't remember how he'd gotten in, but he was at the back, the entrance probably out the far side. Hector could feel the weather was going to get worse soon, not that it was great right now.

He never liked it in this place. It was always "almost" raining. Grey clouds, cold breezes, the wet rotting stink of vegetables, fish and damp concrete was something that he never quite got used to. He never wanted to be here, and he certainly didn't want to get used to it. He'd been trapped in this city by poverty and vices that he couldn't sustain. His original plans had long gone to hell, and now he was just scrapping by hopping to get lucky someday and be able to leave. This city had taken a lot from him, and he'd tried to fight it, but it leached into him, just like the rust and damp that leached into everything else here.

*Crack*

The noise came from the front of the yard. Hector froze, suddenly wishing his cover of trash and mud was still on top of him.

*Crack*

He heard it more clearly this time, and it sounded wet and painful. He knew that sound from witnessing it. You didn't make it as far as he did without seeing some horrible things. He knew it wasn't anything he wanted to get involved in, so he leaned forwards and made to crawl along the poorly maintained fence, hoping for a break in the links he could crawl through.

*Crack*

He crawled perpendicular to the noise, as best he could manage. On hands and knees, he scuttled along the fence. He could feel the hairs on the back of his neck starting to rise. He knew he was in danger from something that he didn't want to be involved in.

*Crack*

He turned his head this time, hoping not to see anything between the heaps of trash, but figuring he'd at least see if he'd been made yet. All he could see was trash, but he heard voices now.

"-ck was that!?", one deep male voice.

"'ell if I know, *muffled noises* did you see his skull! ... eyes", another man's voice yelled, sounding slightly smaller than the other.


He was in the orange zone, as it was called. This was a place that had been all but abandoned by the city and was considered barely habitable. Of course that meant that it was habited by people who barely counted. The city was divided up into three zones, green, orange, and red.

Green was the newest zone, post war construction, and while it's residents where not exclusively well off, it was where all the new efforts were made. He'd been up and down it's streets many times, but with more modernization came more eyes and therefore more risks for those like Hector. Getting mobbed by some gang, beat by some corporate enforcers, or scooped up by some unhealthy organization were all very real possibilities. They all knew that nobody would come looking for someone who looked like he did. Someone covered in dirt and rags, someone who sculked alone with any friends. They were the prey for anyone.

The orange zone was only marginally better off. In a place where everyone was up against the wall, at least you knew the game. It was pre war, so most of the zone was in shambles, with a few buildings and structures that made notable exceptions. This zone was ruled by gangs and warlords who needed bases to run their empires, and places like this were great for the very same reasons Hector was here. Fewer eyes, more danger. Lower gangs set up shop in whatever they could scavenger, which was always more than they could feasibly manage, and cut each other to bits a vain attempts to try and maintain their overreaching greed.

*Crack*

"..id you see it! That bastard twitched again!!" the first voice yelled.

"... leave it alone. ... didn't 'ave any cash anyways. 'ucking waste o' time!" the second voice yelled back as he started walking away.

"..creeps" said the second as he followed his companion.

Wait. Hector could hear the crunch, suck of their steps walking out the front of the yard. Wait. Nothing happened, and he moved closer to the body. Having frozen, he slowly stood up. Every movement brought more protests from his sore and spent muscles. His body protested like it had run a marathon while he was passed out, but he ignored it. Slowly he scuttled towards where the crunching sound had been coming from. He only just noticed that chest was pounding, and it only compounded his perception of the risks he was taking. But he had to look. Of course he knew what it was. Only one thing made that kind of noise. Hector knew the person was dead, or very close to it. This freshly made corpse had clearly gotten caught, and they were now paying the price.

He crept closer to the body, moving around some broken wood piles, to get a better look. It lying face up in the center of a small clearing. A gurgling noise was coming from the heap of gore. The bubbling was wet, slow, and rhythmic. Everything was a mess. Blood had pooled all around the body, and stained everything a deep red. The clothes seemed to be more akin to robes, long and draped down the body, maybe white or tan, but they'd been stained dark grey and deep red by the mud, blood, and gore. As he moved closer, he could make out the arms and legs, but 3 of them had been brutally wrenched and now pointed in unnatural and wrong angles. Hector winced involuntarily as he saw bubbles rise from the chest. It had been caved in, and slit across the belly. Organs Hector didn't recognize could be seen slopping inside with each gurgle and bubble. How anyone could be alive, still, was beyond him. As he gawked in horror at the chest, his eyes slowly moved up the corpse and tried to make sense of the head. The skull was gone. Actually it was a wet pile that no lunger resembled a skull, but rather a rotten squash that had been smashed to bits. Brain matter was splashed around the mud such that he couldn't tell where mud started and brain began. Hector could feel fear welling up in his chest, he knew something was wrong. He'd always trusted his gut, and he always been better for it. Between the small bubbles oozing from the rended chest, the smashed skull, and the bent limbs Hector almost didn't see it. His brain was slow from the oncoming hangover, and he was still wrapped up in the why of this abhorrent war crime. Even by gang standards this seemed excessive. This person had fucked up.

Standing there a few extra seconds, Hector realized why this gave him the chills. He slowly started backing away, body reacting before his brain could catch up. The arms were too long, the chest was too small, and the skull, what was left, almost angular. This body wasn't normal, wasn't fully human. Suddenly Hector could only see wrongness on it. He tripped on some wooden debris and fell backwards on his ass. The bubbling seemed to reach into him. He felt ill all of a sudden. He turned and started clambering on all four limbs towards the back, desperate to leave through some hidden break in the fence. He couldn't explain his fear. Perhaps it was the wrongness of the body? Maybe it was just the hangover? Maybe he was still high? Either way he had to leave. Now. His fingers were covered in lumpy mud and specks of garbage. His clothes were still caked in it, and now every time he moved parts either fell off, or stuck anew. He winced at the noises coming from him, horrified that he was making more noise than whatever else was in the yard. He did not feel alone anymore. On all fours, he made it back to the fence. He stood up fully, for what felt like the first time in ages. His body was stiff and sore from it's continued abuse. He followed the fence towards the opposite corner from where he started, desperately looking for a gap to exploit. His heart was pounding and his head hurt anew. He couldn't explain this reaction but he knew to trust it and get away from this place. He swore he could feel eyes on him. What was it that the ganger had said about eyes? He Ignored the thought, and kept following the fence.

Just around some tall concrete and steel boxes he saw his escape. Some metal pipes had been stacked flat next to the fence. Secured by vertical moorings they were lying length ways, and were stacked high enough that if he climbed on top, he could jump off them, and over the fence. He stepped up to the pipe and tried putting his booted foot on the first pipe. He immediately slipped off the pipe and loudly cracked his shin on it, only managing to stay upright by reflexively grabbing the closest mooring post that was holding the pipes stacked. The sucked in a breath and quickly tried again, this time using the mooring as support, and more carefully judging the slippage from the mud, slime, and general decay of his boots. Several careful steps later and he was standing on the pipes, ready to jump over the fence and be free of whatever horrors were here. He took one last look back, sure he'd see something standing over the body looking at him. But nothing was there. He turned, and as fluidly as he could leapt over the fence.

He did land gracefully. The fence, while not razor tipped was still slightly higher than the stack of pipes, and so he had to tuck his legs in the air. This meant that he landed in a heap on the other side. He caught himself on his hand and knees in the gravel, rather than fully fall onto his stomach. He landed on a small gravel road that served as the alley between yards. The gravel stung and clung to his hands and knees while he struggled to get up. Brushing it off, he got to walking away as quickly as his groaning muscles would let him go. The comfort of his sanity was his highest priority, so his muscles and their respective issues got pushed to the back of his mind as he limped away down the road, opposite of where he started, and ever further from the wrongness.

He could feel his heart start to beat normally again, and his subconsciousness felt less threatened for his immediate safety. Limping down the gravel road he quickly passed the next yard and turned away towards the opposite side. He now felt the hangover thudding into his skull, and he knew he had to get home. He continued crossing the meager gravel alley road and went to squeeze between two standing concrete buildings. He was thought he was familiar with this industrial area, but couldn't confirm it just yet. The problem with waking up was he always seemed to forget how he'd arrived. He'd probably walked in through the front gate of that yard so now he'd have to circle back once he cleared this gap. Halfway squeezing through, half shuffling, he scrapped down one of the concrete walls towards a main road at the other end of this dark, half hearted tunnel. Stepping over debris, he pulled down on his filthy hoodie, and adjusted his pants' belt. Reaching the end, he lurched into the light, like some ghoul and stood on the walkway on the next road.



--



The orange zone was one three zones. Green, Orange, and Red, each coded by livability. The orange zone was a collection of ruins, and shanty-growth that barely supported life. Buildings that were considered dangerous and unusable sat scattered throughout, supported by haphazard construction and cannibalistic scavenging from other ruins and abandoned shanty work. Most of the original buildings still had scars from the war that scorched this town from decades past. Explosions, bullets, and fighting had destroyed and crippled the southern bay of the city. But no-one had come back after the war. While the green zone had been rebuilt, the other zones had been left behind. Ugly scars on the city that nobody cared about, or wanted to deal with. It was far easier to build new, or start where their was already nothing standing than to venture out into a desolate war zone to find something livable. And it was still a war zone. People were still finding equipment, weapons, and bombs scattered throughout, and people were still fighting over the scraps both old an new. That's were Hector made his living, but not by choice. He was a thief, a dealer, and a fighter when necessary. He didn't want to be here, and he hated the condition that it left him in day after day, but it was either struggle or die. He didn't have it in him to die. When he got low he turned to drugs, and lately he'd been low often. But his luck would change, he knew it. The next big score was out there. All he needed to do was find it.


, and inched towards the side opposite to where the noises where coming from. Inching towards the corner, he didn't want to be seen witnessing this, but he still wanted to know who was involved. At the corner he found more boxes parked at an angle, such that there was a slit he could look through. He squinted his eyes against the harsh glare that was coming off some metal pipes across the yard until he could just make out some figures. A man had a metal pipe and was wielding it like a bat in two hands. Three men other stood around watching, or looking back towards the entrance of the yard. The pipe was slick with gore and the one wielding it had spatters of blood all over himself. None of them seemed to care. Hector saw the mess in the middle. Whatever, or whoever it was wasn't getting up anytime soon. 
*Crunch*

The one with the pipe swung again. Making the horrible noise as the pipe cracked into the prone figure on the muddy ground. By the noises,  He stayed still, watching, determined to witness this incase these gangers broke off in his direction. Better to see them coming his way and get a head start running, than get caught as well. They started talking.

"...'nough" Said a man standing back and observing the carnage.
"...thought we wanted to send a message" said the one with the pipe in a thuggish and brash accent. He was covered up to his knees in blood and gore.
"Message sent. Now come on, we're supposed to collect more holdings today" replied the observing man.
"Fine" said the man with pipe, and he nonchalantly tossed it into the air. It flipped end over end and bounced off the body one last time with loud thump-clack of metal and bone. He didn't seem bothered by the gore or blood, or the mess it'd left on him.

They all started walking across the yard towards the entrance. The other two had been watching the gate to make sure that nobody disturbed the ruthless murder. As they all left none of them turned or checked behind them. In front of the yard they crossed out of Hector's view, to the right of the building. With them all gone, Hector slowly crouch walked around the boxes to get a look at the body in the middle of the yard. He slowly stood up from his bent position, and his back reminded him that he had been passed out without consulting it how best to lay down. He let out an involuntary groan as he straitened up. He stopped. He was just paranoid enough to believe that he wasn't alone.


Whoever they were, there would be no identifying the body from facial matches. The whole face had been caved in, and the chest was broken open to reveal ribs, and guts. Blood slowly seeped out through the back of the corpse, and stained the mud an even dirtier color. Their clothes were a faded crimson color, and had been stained even darker from the blood. There was a lot of blood. Hector looked away towards the gate and then back at the corpse. He almost didn't notice the strangeness of the outfit. The corpse was wearing some sort of smock. It had a hood that had folded under it's skull, but the robes themselves were still visible across the bodies' sides and legs.

Hector didn't know what to make of the outfit, but he decided to leave before anyone else came his way. He'd only stopped for a minute, and he didn't trust this place. This city had eyes everywhere. He pulled up his filthy hood, and wiped off some mud from his jacket as he tried to look presentable. At least for an addict.
Making his way to the gate, he slowly peered to his right, leaning out from behind the building to see if the gangsters were still in view. His paranoia was well founded. Not only did he witness them brutally murder someone beyond recognition, but he probably owed them money as well. Hector was not well off in this city. He had and had made a lot of enemies over the years and he'd ripped off his fair share of gangsters. He didn't have any remorse for the people he had cheated. They would have done the same to him.

He couldn't see anyone, and so he made to his left, opposite from the gangsters. While they were headed the same way he wanted to go, he couldn't just follow them out. He figured he'd just cut perpendicular through the next yard, and then continue towards his home. He started into the street, crossed the gaps between the this yard and the next husk of a building, and was about to turn into another abandoned yard when he heard a yell from behind him. He turned his head, and to his horror the gore covered gangster had appeared around the far corner. Hector locked eyes with the man for a split second, and then turned to run.

He let out another groan as he forced his already protesting body to move in ways it did not intend to. Running, he grabbed the corner of the building and swung himself around, and slammed half tilt into a fence. He had miss-judged the next buildings yard gate and slammed into the fence instead. He clumsily bounced off the fence, and fell backwards onto his ass. He twisted and pushed up onto to feet, checking to see if his pursuer had made any progress. The man had. The man, covered in gore up to his knees was half way past the collapsed far building and was closing fast. The gangster was yelling for the others to get Suddenly adrenalin pumped into Hector's veins and he pushed his body into overdrive. He stood up and ran towards the open gate, not five meters from him. This time he swung around the gate correctly, and kept moving full tilt into the partially abandoned yard. He ran around a pile of big metal pipes and leapt over some scattered woden pallets. He ran, headed for the fence at the back. He fully intended to get over it no matter what the physical cost. Hector had learned long ago, that nothing could be worse than getting caught. Passing fallen boxes at a blur, he quickly turned his head to see how he was doing. The man was further behind than he had hoped, but he was still coming. Before he could straighten his neck, Hector once again crashed into a fence. This time he grabbed hold with his fingers and managed to stay upright. He stopped and looked left and right to try and find some way over the fence. The fence was taller than him, and had barbed wire lines running across the top leaning outwards. Off to his left Hector saw a stack of pipes stacked on top of each other in a triangular shape. Hector pulled himself along the fence to get him legs going, and made towards the pipe. He slipped on some mud, and let out a yelp as he did. He didn't fall but he had to slow down for a second. He was closing the distance. He was going to get out, he just had to get there. His lungs sucked in air, and all he could hear his heart pumping in his head. All his problems were in front of him, and these problems started with getting on this pile of pipes. He grabbed a tie-down strap and pulled himself up onto the first pipe. His muddy boots slipped on the metal and his shins cracked into it. He kept going, panic blocked out pain. the He pulled on the strap with all his might and hoisted himself up onto the pile. He saw the man had closed quickly and he knew that he was moments from being grabbed. The man let out a yell, probably as much to draw the other murderers, as to throw Hector off. Hector steadied himself, and flung his body with all his might off the top of the triangularly stacked pipes. He felt like he was soaring over through the air and could only imagine the look on his pursuers faces as he cleared the fence. He didn't fully clear the fence. His pant leg caught the barbs and be was jerked violently to the right as the barbs dug into his leg. He twisted in the air as his pant leg pulled him into the fence. He screamed in pain and panic as he was bounced into the fence by the leg of his pants and the flesh of his shin. After what felt like eons of dangling the fabric finally tore and he collapsed into a painful heap next to the fence. His head was pulsing and he could feel pain like fire burning up from his tore leg. He couldn't look at it, and he rolled away from the fence.

"Imma get you!" Yelled one of the gangers.
"Quick, o'the fence!" Barked another one.

Hector's head was swimming in pain and exhaustion. He hurt, and it was this place's fault. He willed his pain and fear into anger and frustration. He hated this place. If it was not for the city he would not be in this mess. That anger fulled him, and in a split second he pushed up from the ground and ran with all his might. He pumped his arms and legs and ran. In his desperation he hadn't had a chance to plan this far ahead, but he was in an alley, between work yards, and collapsing buildings. He took off in the direction he'd been intending to go, and pushed his body to it's limit. The buildings, and garbage blurred past him as he ran. Hector was looking for any that he could disappear into. He didn't even glance behind him and he pushed down the alley. It was barely wider than him in some places due the ruble and garbage. He quickly cut behind some brick rubble and kep moving down the road. At the next corner he turned and kept running down the gap between two buildings. It was almost too narrow to run full tilt, but he forced his way through, twisting his shoulders to keep his speed. He could see a pile of trash at the end, and he knew he'd have to climb over it, or through it. He dreaded the noise he'd make, but he pushed forwards. He made it to the pile, and stepped onto the first bag. He did not sink into it like he had suspected, and found that it was mostly solid. He realized that these were all concrete bags that had solidified. He took this as a sign that he was destined for greatness and climbed up the pile. This was it, he was about to get away free. He couldn't hear anyone behind him, or any yelling further up the alley. He was going to beat this problem, and the next one and next just like he had always dreamed. He was hand over hand climbing the pile that rose to his should, and when he reached the top, he pulled his now shaking body over the lip. He tumbled over, andd landed in a head on a street. He was exhausted, but it wasn't over yet. He needed a bolt hole to check himself, and then make his way home. Crawling forwards he saw that he wasn't alone on this street.

There were other people wandering around, but none of them looked like the thugs that were chasing him. None of them moved with any particular urgency, and they seemed to only give the barest of attention after his graceless fall into their street. He knew immediately that they were just like him. Well not just like him, but they too were addicts, or hustlers, or unwanted that were looking out for themselves. He was better than them, but he knew them from personal experience. He tried to stand, but his leg was still on fire. He used the last of his willpower trying to scale that pile, and now his leg was simply not going to cooperate. he crawled forwards on 3 limbs around a corner into a doorway. It was a semi-standing building with burns across the bricking and coming out from the windows. The door had been glass at one point, but was now just blackened and shattered. He crawled through the bottom separation of the door, and at the midway point, rolled onto his back and hoisted his leg past the glass with his hands. He struggled into the cramped and blackened room on his back, holding his leg up as he scrapped along the floor. Once he cleared it, he let go and kept crawling along the floor until he was cornered a small shelf that had collapsed into the floor. He lay on the ground panting, shaking, sweating, and almost in tears from the pain of it all.

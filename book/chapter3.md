Hector's world slowly came back into focus. Consciousness leaked back into his body. It started in his hands and feet, and slowly moved up into his arms, legs, and shoulders. Eventually it reached his head. It slowly self assessed and confirmed he was alive and mostly intact. Hector slowly opened his eyes and squinted as the light seeped in. His vision was blurry and filled with spots. While his world slowly came into focus, he guessed it was mid morning.

He'd curled up in a corner where a chain-link fence met a wall. The fencing had slats for privacy, but those had long since degraded into mere suggestions. The other side was a corrugated metal wall that had rusted into a husk of it's former glory. It had been a complete building at one point, but it had collapsed and the exposed metal beams now looked like ribs on a carcass. Rust seeped out into his corner, and made the metaphor look even more convincing with it's dark red and black stains on his clothes and the trash he'd slept on. The wind caused the metal to groan and whistle, as if the building hadn't finished dying yet despite it's exposed organs and hemorrhaging blood. Between the rust, and scavenging, Hector figured it didn't have long before it collapsed into itself and finally died. Hector slowly propped up against the corrugated wall to try and see past the heaps, further into the yard. The yard was only marginally better. The gravel had long since been turned to mud, and garbage was pilled everywhere. Hector has been upwind of most of it, but the damp smell of rot, and rust was still present. His head started to ache and the groaning metal corpse he was sitting against was only accelerating what was going to be a crippling withdrawal migraine. He slowly moved and pushed off his makeshift cover of damp cardboard. He slowly rolled onto his back, and stretched his legs. He silently thanked himself for passing out in a position that hadn't left him completely crippled with soreness.

He slowly pushed himself up into a sitting position against the wall. His grimy clothes helped him slide up the wall rather than scrub it, and he sat upright for a minute. Slowly he tried to focus is spinning mind. The drugs always wore off in stages but this stage had been more delayed. He rubbed his temple with one dirty hand and then massaged some feeling back into his shoulder with the other. The pain slowly hit him as the drugs continued to wear off. He was coming down from his latest high, and he knew it wouldn't be good. Propping himself up some more, ever so slowly, and with careful movements he tried to see more of the yard. He didn't remember how he'd gotten in, but he was at the back, the entrance probably out the far side. Hector could feel the weather was going to get worse soon, not that it was great right now.

He never liked it in this place. It was always "almost" raining. Grey clouds, cold breezes, the wet rotting stink of vegetables, fish and damp concrete was something that he never quite got used to. He never wanted to be here, and he certainly didn't want to get used to it. He'd been trapped in this city by poverty and vices that he couldn't sustain. His original plans had long gone to hell, and now he was just scrapping by hopping to get lucky someday and be able to leave. This city had taken a lot from him, and he'd tried to fight it, but it leached into him, just like the rust and damp that leached into everything else here.

*Crack*

The noise came from the front of the yard. Hector froze, suddenly wishing his cover of trash and mud was still on top of him.

*Crack*

He heard it more clearly this time, and it sounded wet and painful. He knew that sound from witnessing it. You didn't make it as far as he did without seeing some horrible things. He knew it wasn't anything he wanted to get involved in, so he leaned forwards and made to crawl along the poorly maintained fence, hoping for a break in the links he could crawl through.

*Crack*

He crawled perpendicular to the noise, as best he could manage. On hands and knees, he scuttled along the fence. He could feel the hairs on the back of his neck starting to rise. He knew he was in danger from something that he didn't want to be involved in.

*Crack*

He turned his head this time, hoping not to see anything between the heaps of trash, but figuring he'd at least see if he'd been made yet. All he could see was trash, but he heard voices now.

"-ck was that!?", one deep male voice.

"'ell if I know, *muffled noises* did you see his skull! ... eyes", another man's voice yelled, sounding slightly smaller than the other.

He was in the orange zone, as it was called. This was a place that had been all but abandoned by the city and was considered barely habitable. Of course that meant that it was habited by people who barely counted. The city was divided up into three zones, green, orange, and red.

Green was the newest zone, post war construction, and while it's residents where not exclusively well off, it was where all the new efforts were made. He'd been up and down it's streets many times, but with more modernization came more eyes and therefore more risks for those like Hector. Getting mobbed by some gang, beat by some corporate enforcers, or scooped up by some unhealthy organization were all very real possibilities. They all knew that nobody would come looking for someone who looked like he did. Someone covered in dirt and rags, someone who sculked alone with any friends. They were the prey for anyone.

The orange zone was only marginally better off. In a place where everyone was up against the wall, at least you knew the game. It was pre war, so most of the zone was in shambles, with a few buildings and structures that made notable exceptions. This zone was ruled by gangs and warlords who needed bases to run their empires, and places like this were great for the very same reasons Hector was here. Fewer eyes, more danger. Lower gangs set up shop in whatever they could scavenger, which was always more than they could feasibly manage, and cut each other to bits a vain attempts to try and maintain their overreaching greed.

*Crack*

"..id you see it! That bastard twitched again!!" the first voice yelled.

"... leave it alone. ... didn't 'ave any cash anyways. 'ucking waste o' time!" the second voice yelled back as he started walking away.

"..creeps" said the second as he followed his companion.

Wait. Hector could hear the crunch, suck of their steps walking out the front of the yard. Wait. Nothing happened, and he moved closer to the body. Having frozen, he slowly stood up. Every movement brought more protests from his sore and spent muscles. His body protested like it had run a marathon while he was passed out, but he ignored it. Slowly he scuttled towards where the crunching sound had been coming from. He only just noticed that chest was pounding, and it only compounded his perception of the risks he was taking. But he had to look. Of course he knew what it was. Only one thing made that kind of noise. Hector knew the person was dead, or very close to it. This freshly made corpse had clearly gotten caught, and they were now paying the price.

He crept closer to the body, moving around some broken wood piles, to get a better look. It lying face up in the center of a small clearing. A gurgling noise was coming from the heap of gore. The bubbling was wet, slow, and rhythmic. Everything was a mess. Blood had pooled all around the body, and stained everything a deep red. The clothes seemed to be more akin to robes, long and draped down the body, maybe white or tan, but they'd been stained dark grey and deep red by the mud, blood, and gore. As he moved closer, he could make out the arms and legs, but 3 of them had been brutally wrenched and now pointed in unnatural and wrong angles. Hector winced involuntarily as he saw bubbles rise from the chest. It had been caved in, and slit across the belly. Organs Hector didn't recognize could be seen slopping inside with each gurgle and bubble. How anyone could be alive, still, was beyond him. As he gawked in horror at the chest, his eyes slowly moved up the corpse and tried to make sense of the head. The skull was gone. Actually it was a wet pile that no lunger resembled a skull, but rather a rotten squash that had been smashed to bits. Brain matter was splashed around the mud such that he couldn't tell where mud started and brain began. Hector could feel fear welling up in his chest, he knew something was wrong. He'd always trusted his gut, and he always been better for it. Between the small bubbles oozing from the rended chest, the smashed skull, and the bent limbs Hector almost didn't see it. His brain was slow from the oncoming hangover, and he was still wrapped up in the why of this abhorrent war crime. Even by gang standards this seemed excessive. This person had fucked up.

Standing there a few extra seconds, Hector realized why this gave him the chills. He slowly started backing away, body reacting before his brain could catch up. The arms were too long, the chest was too small, and the skull, what was left, almost angular. This body wasn't normal, wasn't fully human. Suddenly Hector could only see wrongness on it. He tripped on some wooden debris and fell backwards on his ass. The bubbling seemed to reach into him. He felt ill all of a sudden. He turned and started clambering on all four limbs towards the back, desperate to leave through some hidden break in the fence. He couldn't explain his fear. Perhaps it was the wrongness of the body? Maybe it was just the hangover? Maybe he was still high? Either way he had to leave. Now. His fingers were covered in lumpy mud and specks of garbage. His clothes were still caked in it, and now every time he moved parts either fell off, or stuck anew. He winced at the noises coming from him, horrified that he was making more noise than whatever else was in the yard. He did not feel alone anymore. On all fours, he made it back to the fence. He stood up fully, for what felt like the first time in ages. His body was stiff and sore from it's continued abuse. He followed the fence towards the opposite corner from where he started, desperately looking for a gap to exploit. His heart was pounding and his head hurt anew. He couldn't explain this reaction but he knew to trust it and get away from this place. He swore he could feel eyes on him. What was it that the ganger had said about eyes? He Ignored the thought, and kept following the fence.

Just around some tall concrete and steel boxes he saw his escape. Some metal pipes had been stacked flat next to the fence. Secured by vertical moorings they were lying length ways, and were stacked high enough that if he climbed on top, he could jump off them, and over the fence. He stepped up to the pipe and tried putting his booted foot on the first pipe. He immediately slipped off the pipe and loudly cracked his shin on it, only managing to stay upright by reflexively grabbing the closest mooring post that was holding the pipes stacked. The sucked in a breath and quickly tried again, this time using the mooring as support, and more carefully judging the slippage from the mud, slime, and general decay of his boots. Several careful steps later and he was standing on the pipes, ready to jump over the fence and be free of whatever horrors were here. He took one last look back, sure he'd see something standing over the body looking at him. But nothing was there. He turned, and as fluidly as he could leapt over the fence.

He did land gracefully. The fence, while not razor tipped was still slightly higher than the stack of pipes, and so he had to tuck his legs in the air. This meant that he landed in a heap on the other side. He caught himself on his hand and knees in the gravel, rather than fully fall onto his stomach. He landed on a small gravel road that served as the alley between yards. The gravel stung and clung to his hands and knees while he struggled to get up. Brushing it off, he got to walking away as quickly as his groaning muscles would let him go. The comfort of his sanity was his highest priority, so his muscles and their respective issues got pushed to the back of his mind as he limped away down the road, opposite of where he started, and ever further from the wrongness.

He could feel his heart start to beat normally again, and his subconsciousness felt less threatened for his immediate safety. Limping down the gravel road he quickly passed the next yard and turned away towards the opposite side. He now felt the hangover thudding into his skull, and he knew he had to get home. He continued crossing the meager gravel alley road and went to squeeze between two standing concrete buildings. He was thought he was familiar with this industrial area, but couldn't confirm it just yet. The problem with waking up was he always seemed to forget how he'd arrived. He'd probably walked in through the front gate of that yard so now he'd have to circle back once he cleared this gap. Halfway squeezing through, half shuffling, he scrapped down one of the concrete walls towards a main road at the other end of this dark, half hearted tunnel. Stepping over debris and muck, he pulled up the hood on his filthy hoodie, and adjusted his pants' belt. Looking less meek and more capable, he stepped out of the damn darkness of the gap, and surveyed where he'd ended up.

About a block down the road he saw some people milling past the buildings, and further down he could make out an intersection with some vehicles waiting to proceed. The road itself was narrow and the buildings seemed to lean forwards past their foundations, further lending to the cramped feeling of the industrial sector. Cabling running at uneven intervals between the buildings made it feel like a jungle of concrete, plastic, and metal. Some lit-up signs advertised various businesses, but they were sparsely placed, hinting at the slummy nature of this place. In the other direction, much of the same, though Hector could see some buildings had actively collapsed and were spilling onto the sidewalk. He started towards his home, towards the intersection.

The orange zone was a collection of ruins, and shanty-growth that barely supported life. Buildings that were considered dangerous and unusable sat scattered throughout, supported by haphazard construction and cannibalistic scavenging from other ruins and abandoned shanty work. Most of the original buildings still had scars from the war that scorched this town from decades past. Explosions, bullets, and fighting had destroyed and crippled the southern bay of the city. But no-one had come back after the war. While the green zone had been rebuilt, the other zones had been left behind. Ugly scars on the city that nobody cared about, or wanted to deal with. It was far easier to build ne where there was already nothing than to venture out into a desolate war zone to find something livable. And it was still a war zone. People were still finding equipment, weapons, and munitions scattered throughout, and people were still fighting over the scraps both old an new. That's were Hector made his living, but not by choice. He was a thief, a dealer, and a fighter when necessary. He didn't want to be here, and he hated the condition that it left him in day after day, but it was either struggle or die. He didn't have it in him to die. When he got low he turned to drugs, and lately he'd been low often. But his luck would change, he knew it. The next big score was out there. All he needed to do was find it.

He kept walking past the intersection, passing people arguing, waiting vehicles, and huddled crowds of failures - probably liking themselves to him. He didn't look any of them in the eye, for fear of failing himself. He felt that he kept a better standard than them, and probably unlike them he had someplace dry to sleep. Of course it was only mostly dry. Hector lived in the red zone. The abandoned part of the city. Past the seawall. The red zone was not necesailiry un-livable, but it was unaccessible and actively in decline due to the fact that it was actively being swallowed up by the sea. It was the oldest part of the city. From back before the weather turned sour, and the water levels were lower. Hector had heard that this place was once nice to live in. People claimed it had been prosperous and temperate. Nowadays the water and the wind dominated the landscape with its endless depth, and the biting tear. If it wasn't the water sucking you under, the wind knocked you down. The weather had been the biggest decline of the city. The wars had certainly helped, but at some point in the history of earth, we'd fought each other with such ferocity that the weather had changed into an enemy. Now humanity was scrapping by. By all counts we were something of a lost cause by Hector's count. It seemed that everyday we fought each other, and killed more of our own, only for the earth to chip away even more. It was less about survival of the fittest, and more survival of the lucky.

Luck would shine on Hector soon. His gut told him so, and he always trusted his gut. Following the road and the soon the smell of damp concrete Hector made it to the sea wall. The wall wasn't something you could stand on, something to keep the city in, but rather to keep the water out. Of course there were still places to go through it, you just had to know somebody. Hector followed the wall inward, towards the central city, until he reached a place he was familiar with. He'd made it to a square that was busy with people

Derik was sitting at the far end of the long conference room table. The room was darkly lit, with the only lights suspended above the oblong dark table spanning the cold and uninviting room. This place was dark and forgoing. The walls had neat rows of dimmed monitors streaming endless jargon and information that nobody bothered to read or try to comprehend. If you needed it, you were already done. If you can in here you had better come prepared.

Today there were just short of a dozen people seated all around the table. Each one was in a dark suit of identical hue. Each of them wore white shirts with no ties, and did their best to keep the creases straight. The light was playing off their faces so that you could only see their features properly when they faced forwards, or leaned in. He chose to sit a the far end because he hated this room. He hated the people in this room the most. They were all sharks as far as he was concerned. All the men and women surrounding him had cold eyes and distrustful looks about them. Each one looking like they could destroy you with only a word. Nobody in this room was his friend, and they knew it too. This place might as well have been the bottom of the ocean for all the pressure and noise. The dark swallowed up the spaces around them. Only this table and the sharks existed now. The quite was defining. He could almost hear his own heartbeat.

Quietly, the man at the end of the table stood up and raised his fist to his chest, knuckles facing in so that it looked almost like he was experiencing ~~cardio~~ distress. Quickly everyone at the table, including himself, copied the gesture from a seated position. The soft rustling of suit jackets was the only noise that broke the silence. They all remained frozen like this, nobody moved, or made more noise. Derik could hear the blood pumping through his veins. His heart was pounding. His wrist was somehow straining just to keep this simple pose. Nobody showed any signs of faltering or distress and he wondering if they too could somehow sense his weakness. After only a few more heartbeats, the leader dropped his hand and returned to his seat. Everyone else simply let their hands fall to the table without making a noise.

"I want you all to know that we've called this meeting due to a recent discovery in the logs", spoke the man at the head of the table. His voice was dark and cold, just like the room.

"The analystics have noticed a pattern and brought it to SecOps immediately, who alerted me soon after."

Derik did everything in his power to remain straight, and to not show any change in position. He Knew that any movement, any shift in his position could jeopardize him. Of course he didn't do anything, but in this place anything could be used against you.


"Walter Sequoyah".

That's my name today. These days nobody will ask, but it's good to work it out ahead of time anyways. Loitering outside is

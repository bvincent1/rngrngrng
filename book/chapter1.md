The room was known as the shark tank. It was dark, quiet, and you knew that once you went in you were in danger. It was
an interior room with glass walls, but the only lights in the whole floor were from data streaming onto wall panels
surrounding the room, and the single light source positioned above the table. The table was a long rectangular
conference table, cold metal and sparse seating. Everything, including the people, was cold in here. Peter knew it was
on purpose, but he still did his best to calm himself for his meeting. You had to be cold to make it to where he had.
He'd done things to get here. And here was the center of a mega corporation. He was an executive on the acquisitions
team. His job was not pretty, but he knew it had to be done. The room beckoned, and despite how he felt, he willed
himself to be the shark in this tank. He took a deep breath, opened the door and took a seat, first to arrive. When the
door closed behind him it was silent. He could probably hear someone elses heartbeat in here, not just his own. He
smoothly walked to a chair and took a seat. He did not bring any notes, nor did he have any reports to give. This
meeting was not about him. He did not know exactly what it was for, but he knew it was not good. Nothing good ever
happened in the shark tank.

Shortly after he arrived other executives arrived and took their seats. He recognized all of them from various
departments. There was a mishmash of department heads here from legal, inter-corporate relations, analytics, deep
research, and even one the heads of product. He didn't bring his assistant, but if he did they'd have to wait outside
with the others. Each stood ramrod straight and none of them mingled. All were acutely aware that they were about to
witness something, and each was silently praying it wasn't going to be their superior. There was no comradery when your
job was on the line. It was always everyone for themselves, but the high-up corporate world took it to another level.
Here they were enemies, regardless that they were all employed by the same employer. Shark tank indeed.

Last to arrive was the CEO. Kane Carthatch. Peter was among to first to see him, and as soon he did he knew the
situation went from bad to apocalyptic. As soon as Kane entered the room, the tension ratcheted past the ceiling as
everyone sat straighter than if they'd been tazed. Suddenly the room didn't seem so cold. With all the department heads
now stiffly looking across the table at each other, Peter faced the head of product, Emilia Canter, and saw she was
smirking slightly. Not at him, definitely, but because she knew what was going down. He would've killed to know what was
going on, and she probably knew it. Kane took his seat at the far end of the table and waited. He didn't need to call
attention to himself because the room knew he was in charge. It was probably only a few seconds before Kane started
speaking, but it felt like an eternity to Peter. Even with Peter's military background, he'd witnessed firefights come
and go quicker than this. Sweat beaded down his neck into his jet black suit shirt.

"I want you all to know that I'm disappointed, but not at all surprised" Kane spoke in an even, all knowing, tone. "It
has always been a top security concern that we'd be betrayed or infiltrated at any level." He paused for effect. "What
disappoints me is that it's been at the highest level."

Everyone in the room was staring straight ahead, and nobody willing to give an inch. Each of them knew that weakness was
intolerable in this moment. Veterans of corporate violence though they were, probably none of them were ready for this
kind of brazen callout. Peter wondered who the culprit was, but kept his gaze focused on Emilia. She was just as focused
as he was, but something about her suggested she knew. She'd probably been the one to point it out, Peter figured.
That's why she was smug. Of course she didn't dare openly gloat, but clearly she was getting immense satisfaction out of
this. Peter could almost see the satisfaction on her face, just underneath her emotionless corporate mask they'd all
adopted in unison.

Kane continued. "This kind of betrayal will not be dealt with in the usual fashion. Perhaps in the past things these
things would be different. Back when we corporations bowed to laws, or governments. Back when there were rules.
Obviously this is no longer applicable today. Which is why I can't help but wonder how someone who managed to steal from
us, managed to even get this far. Why they'd come at all?" Kane paused again. He was gloating now. "I mean willingly
walking towards your own death isn't brave anymore. There's no more heroes out there, and nobody here would stick their
neck out for another person. Don't think I don't know how yuo'd all probably kill each other in cold blood if you though
you could get away with it. Hell, some of you have killed. Maybe you didn't kill each other, but you've killed before,
and I think you'd do it again."

Peter wasn't quite sure what emotions were going through his head right then. At first it had been chills and that
initial rush of fear and adrenaline, then the light boredom of listening to someone else gloat, but now it had changed
into something else. He felt like maybe Kane had been calling him out directly with that last remark. His military
record was of course on file here, but he couldn't help but feel a certain sense of scrutiny directed his way. Which was
strange, because whatever fuck-up had happened it hadn't been him. He was still dedicated to this company, or at least
he was dedicated to his own success at this company, which was still entirely within acceptable corporate parameters.
Peter kept his eyes straight, but he could only imagine that Kane was watching him from the head of the table.

"I think we've had enough suspense, lets just get this on with." Kane said, without any hint of remorse for what he'd
just ordered.

Peter felt a pair of stiff and cold hands on each of his shoulders. His heart leapt out of his chest, but his gut
tightened into a knot. His reacted without hesitation, shaking of years of rust, physical and mental conditioning
surging back to into his body. He grabbed a wrist, and pushed off the table, twisting as he went. One hand came free of
his shoulder while the other came across his chest. The man he had by the wrist gave a grunt an then a groan as his head
cracked into the table, and Peter released him immediately. The send man was reaching for towards his waist, clearly
about to make for a gun. Peter used his twisting motion to swing his first into the guard's head. The man leaned back to
dodge, but stumbled on the chair momentarily leaving an opening. Peter followed up with an uppercut with his now free
hand and landed it square under the guard's thick, cleanly shaven jaw. There was a crack, and the guard tumbled
backwards. Peter was moving for the door. Not with a plan, but with a direction. He didn't know how it had happened,but
someone had set him up. Clearly there'd been a mistake or, more likely, deliberate sabotage. He made it a couple steps
when his back arched and his legs suddenly flew out from under him as if they suddenly changed their minds. Time moves
slowly in moments like that. It had all probably only been a couple of seconds, but even then it came crashing in a wave
as he slowly fell to the floor. His back arched painfully and he knew he'd been tazed, and that the adrenalin had just
prevented him from feeling the spikes. He knew that he'd been setup by Emilia, and that it had been no mistake that she
had sat across from him. He knew that he was going to die. Probably not right away, but the grand speak Kane had given,
had all but guaranteed his intentions for this kind of betrayal. Peter hadn't even tried to talk his way out of it,
which probably wouldn't have done anything, but it certainly would have made for a more convincing case for his
innocence. Even as the floor rushed towards him he was powerless to do anything about it, his arms pinned to his sides
by the constricting current running through his muscles. He closed his eyes and waited.

Crack.

Peter didn't wake up all once. Consciousness came back slowly. His head was throbbing, and his wrists were sore from
rubbing, and from something cutting into them. He faded out again. When he woke up the second time, he felt cold and
sore. His chest and legs ached with stiffness. He could feel he was laying on his back, at an angle, and with his arms
at his sides. He'd been strapped by metal bonds to some cold, metal, surgical slab. His neck, feet, and hands were all
secured with metal clasps, and there were tight straps across his chest. Someone had cut open his expensive black suit,
and ,he guessed, attached monitors to his chest and sides. He loosened his squint some more. There were lights on him,
but not blinding, like interrogation lights just normal lights. He was in a clinical looking room of concrete floors and
tile walls. There were no shelves, only the walls or in the corners that he could see only some wheeled carts with
equipment on them. He didn't see a door, which meant it had to be behind him, but he did see a camera in the corner. It
didn't have any indicator lights, but Peter knew it had to be active and monitoring him. He looked closer at the tools
on the metal carts and didn't recognize much. There were some probes, and tweezers but most of it seemed to be medical
monitoring equipment equipment. One of the carts had a machine that looked like it was for radio signal monitoring. He
recognized the shape from his time in the military, but he'd never used this particular model. The ones he had used were
for signal jamming or monitoring. He was at a loss as to why they'd have something like that here.

The there was a rusty creak from behind him and Peter smelled ozone from the hallway. He heard rubber shoes on the
concrete as the new visitor appeared from behind him, door screeching closed behind them. They were in surgical uniform,
and had a mask on. He couldn't make out any distinguishing feature, or even their gender past the gown, gloves and mask
that were all clinically worn by this person. He suddenly looked closer at the tools, instantly on edge that he was
about to be tortured. But he checked again and didn't see anything sharp, heavy, or even menacing looking. He wasn't
going to be tortured. While that realization helped with the rapid beating in his chest, his blood still ran cold with
the realization that something potentially worse was about to happen. He was clearly part of some experiment, and this
person was about to administer it to him. He started struggling, the metal clasps around his wrist cut painfully into
his already raw skin. The lab tech looked at him once, then continued with their task. His struggles didn't phase them,
and they knew he'd never get out. The tech checked over the signal receiver, once again, double checked that the
monitoring wires were attached to the medical device at the base, then turned to him. Clearly they didn't relish this
part, but he knew what they were about to do. Carefully the technician stepped closer. One foot at a time until they
could carefully reach into his ragged suit and confirm the leads were still attached to him. He felt their cold gloved
hands press the contacts into his skin. Going over each, one by one until they'd checked them all.

He didn't struggle. It was clear that they planned to keep him alive, otherwise why bother with all this. He'd need his
strength, and he focused all his willpower into channeling his days in the forces. It had certainly been a while, and
he'd grown accustomed to better conditions since then, but it was time to embrace the darker side of his life. He'd
pushed in his past life. Pushed into places he didn't want to be, and didn't have the luxury of complaining about.

"Get it over with" he grumbled. The technician didn't react to him. They just finished their task and then walked around
him to the door. He heard it creak open, and then creak shut. The smell of ozone wafted into the room again, but
otherwise he was alone. "Making me wait I guess" he said to himself, out of frustration and nervousness. He was nervous
now. He had to clamp it down. Get control over his fears. He wouldn't give them anything. Not his fears or his
nervousness. Not an inch.

Then he heard a noise from the machine in front of him. For a second he thought it had turned on by itself, but rejected
that nonsense. It had been remotely activated, and was now going through some diagnostic or whatever machines like this
did when they were turned on. He heard some screeches and burps come from it, and the speakers that were connected let
out a faint hum. Whatever it was doing, it had power and it was ready now. It was slow at first. Peter didn't know if
the volume or the speed had increased, but he could faintly make out noises coming from the speaker. The noises were
almost imperceptible at first. Just faint hisses, or crackles that almost merged with the low whines of the lights or
the beating of his heart. He tried to steady himself, tensing against some assault that must be coming. He'd be blasted
with words or noises any second and then he'd have to block it out. He waited. He waited some more. His breathing was
regular, and he could feel time ticking away, but there was nothing. He listened closer now, unsure what to expect. The
noises were just beyond his capabilities. And then they weren't. He heard some clicks, and then a hiss and suddenly he
could make out the noises. They were random. It was just white noise. There was no meaning to it. He found he no longer
had to strain to hear it, and he relaxed in his bonds. He looked up at the ceiling, and the dimmed fluorescent lights
that cast diffused hues of white and yellow across the room.

He felt it. The skin along his spine itched, but starting from the small of his back, all the way to his skull in a
line. His arms suddenly felt tiny pricks of static, like he was being shocked. He could hear the noise, but it no longer
felt random. There was something behind it. Something that he could almost hear, but only if he strained. His skin was
crackling now. He felt sharp jabs in his chest and head. His eyes were burning and he almost shut them but for the need
to focus. He kept his focus on the noises. He could hear everything now. He could hear the singing of the current, the
hums of each molecule in the room. Suddenly it was deafening. He found he could see everything as well. The electrons
scattering across the trapped gasses in the lights, the photons sparking and dancing into being from nothing. It was
everything hen could do to hold onto his own sense of self. He struggled to feel anything to ground himself. The metal
table he was lying on felt far away, the shackles lighter than anything he could imagine. He was almost completely gone
now. Nothing was keeping him here anymore. Then his world collapsed into a single point, and he felt cold.

description: Andrea puts together the pieces, and meets the new version of Hector

"Goddammit!" Andrea yelled.

This guy had pitched forward and was now unconscious. He lay there in the pouring rain, a wet and crumpled lump of
black. He was dead weight now. She couldn't carry him, and she certainly couldn't stay to interrogate him. Andrea looked
down at him, tempted to leave him in the road to get scooped up by the crew that almost killed them just now. She knew
he could still be useful. He had been there longer than her. He could know something that she could use. She bent over
to drag him somewhere safe. Safer. She chided herself. Grabbing an arm she dragged him into the nearest alleyway. It was
cramped and wet, and she bumped his head a few times. He groaned once and she thought he might wake up, but then he
stayed quiet. She let go of his arms, and stepped over him to check on the apartment. She couldn't make out much through
the rain, but she didn't see anyone on the balcony actively looking for them. This team of sweepers were probably more
professional than that. They were probably bagging everything and then getting out. Consummate professionals.

She was a professional, but somehow this lump of dead weight had gotten the best of her. She hated that. It made her
furious that she'd lost to this. That she'd almost been killed. Her thoughts and emotions swirled in her head until she
calmed enough to plan what to do next.

She walked back towards the strewn out body. His whole outfit looked like ex military, but all black and without any
insignias. She didn't recognize the make of any of it, but it was well worn and had clearly seen better days. Despite
the dark, but without his hood up, she could make out his face. He wasn't ugly or scared, and she could see his black
hair had grown out of a crewcut. Some similar black stubble had speckled his face in barely even clumps. He looked pale,
and she thought that maybe the fall had done a number on him. She checked him over, searching his pockets while she
went.

Only a phone. No gun, no tech, not even a knife. Nothing else. This idiot had broken in with nothing. She let out a
groan of her exasperation. After taking a moment, she noticed a small dark pool under one of his arms. She lifted the
arm and checked the wound. Just a scratch, not life threatening. She didn't even bother to make a bandage.

It just occurred to her that she might had been hit. She didn't actively feel anything, but she still did a quick pat
down of herself to check. Chest, arms, legs, ass. She was whole and, now that she'd had a chance to calm down, she was
thinking clearer. She had a plan, and she was going to make it work.

She repositioned his arms to his sides and left him momentarily in the alley. She walked towards the back, and carefully
peaked into the alley beyond. It was littered with trash, including a dented bin strewn across the center, but otherwise
is was empty. She walked out and started searching. She soon found some cardboard that, after shaking off the larger
chunks of slime, would make do. She dragged it back to the alley and found the man still unconscious, right where she'd
left him. She was somewhat surprised that she'd fared so much better than him, but unlike this guy, Andrea had seen the
wall coming at them and braced with her legs appropriately. She felt around in his pockets one more time, added a
present, and then pulled out her phone to confirm her it was working. Once she saw the pulsing icon, she pocketed her
phone and pulled the soaking cardboard over his sopping wet body. She then rolled him onto it and pulled the rest over
his crumpled form. She stood there, inspecting her handiwork. Confident that he'd live she turned and made for the back
alley.

She followed it towards the end of the block, careful not to make herself an easy target should anyone see her. She
checked the street beyond, and continued stealing between alleys for several blocks in the same, careful manner. Once
she'd decided this was enough, she found a tarpan to stand under, pulled out her phone, and tapped some icons to hail a
ride.

While she waited for her ride, she adjusted her look to be more presentable. She undid her scarf, which she'd been using
to cover her face, and wrung it out. She tried to towel her hair with it, fighting the futility of it all. Appearances
were important, she told herself. Never let them see you weak. Her dark hair looked better now, but she was still liable
to shoot anyone who made a comment. On that note, she undid her leg holster and tucked it into her jacket, making sure
it was concealed it in a pocket at her side. Local laws forbid open cary, but it wasn't exactly enforced to a consistent
degree. It was still common enough to see people armed with not only pistols like hers, but full on assault weapons out
in the street. The problem was that it tended to attract the kind of attention that she didn't want right now.

She draped her scarf over her head in a mock hood, and made sure it covered the bulkier straps of her gear harness. A
few minutes later, her ride pulled up and she got in. She locked eyes with the driver in the rear view mirror for a
second, and he quickly looked away. He didn't even wait for her to say anything, and just pulled away from the curb. She
took a moment to appreciate the warmth inside, before letting herself relax and leaning back into the seat. Lights
blurred past outside as they made there way out of this dense blok, and onto the grid streets. The muffled rain, and
whine of the motors felt soothing to Andrea, and she let out a breath she hadn't known she had been holding. In the
distance she could see the lights of the city coming and going. They passed other vehicles, going towards different
bloks, and a feeling of worry slowly ate away at her calm. She imagined some crew coming to track her down, and
interrogate her. They'd be convinced she knew something, and she'd have to convince them that she was just as in the
dark as them. Maybe Emilia would send them. Maybe she'd choose to evaluate her, and make sure Andrea hadn't gone rogue.

Andrea had been at this all day. She had missed her check-in and she knew that would raise alarms. She felt like she had
enough **track** that she could pull it off, but maybe she was wrong. She constantly second guessed her relationships at
the office. Despite all that she'd done, and all that she'd accomplished, shed never fully trust the corporate world. Or
anyone, for that matter. Trusting people got you in trouble. Andrea couldn't afford trouble. Either way, she was sure
she'd get a call about the check-in. She'd have to spin something about following a lead. This Lili Kant had proven much
more competent than her file had lead on to. Andrea had spent the better part of her day tracking her across town, from
one place to the next only to get trounced by some amateur. There she went again, her fear of failure getting replaced
with her rage at disappointment.

How could this random have found out about this? How could he have known? Clearly there was a leak somewhere in
corporate, but what could Andrea even do. That wasn't her domain, her workplace. She was a field operative. A
professional in an industry of un-professional activities. She was busy introspecting her relations and revaluating
herself when the car pulled off the grid, and started towards her blok. The car announced that the grid had ended, with
a soft beep and the driver double checked the range on his battery. The math seemed to line up, since he didn't
immediately kick her out and kept driving.

The rain had eased up by the time she'd arrived at her destination. She got out, and with out so much as a nod the
driver took off. Her phone dinged, and funds were withdrawn from her account. She turned and walked up the steps to the
mega tower doors. A few steps later and she pushed open the heavy metal and glass doors into the interior. It was warmer
than outside, but not without rain curtesy of the open atrium ascending all the way up the building. She made her way to
the elevators, conscious of the pistol holster bumping into her side underneath her jacket. She made it to the elevator,
and punched in her floor number. She waited, hopping no one would get on. She watched as the metal doors inched closer
and closer together, and breathed a sign of relief.

"Hold up", a dry and raspy male voice said, before she saw an ugly hand jut between the doors. Andrea sucked in a
breath, and consciously reassured herself with the pistol pocking into her side. The metals doors opened and she knew
she'd just stumbled into a nightmare. A robed figure, just as ugly as the hand, stepped into the elevator, and nodded to
the floor controls.

"Could you pick floor 124 for me?" A voice creaked from the beneath the hood asked.

Andrea felt her heart flutter, she had already punched that in as her destination. She knew that today must be some sick
joke the universe had decided to play on her. She made a token effort to select the floor, despite it clearly being
highlighted. The elevator doors slowly began closing again, and she wondered if she should just get off and wait for the
next one. But the man would just be there anyways, so she resigned herself to her fate.

With a jolt, the elevator accelerated up and she exhaled slightly, conscious of the breath she'd been holding in.
Without trying to be overt, she tried to get at good look at the man, hoping he wouldn't notice her and try to start a
conversation. The first thing she'd noticed was that his robes weren't particularly ugly like him, but a deep red. The
robes covered him from the hood obscuring his face, to the slight bundling of a filthy train at his feet. All she could
see of the man wearing them was his face and his hands. The attire made him look insect like, almost like a beetle. She
saw his hands were wrinkled, but not so much as with age, but with loose skin. His nails were too long, and lent a
strong comparison to claws. Andrea couldn't help but tilt her head up slightly to try and get a look at his face. His
long and pointed chin stuck out from his hood, followed by thin pale lips, and a curved nose above them. She couldn't
help but follow up the face trying to make out his eyes in the recesses of his face and covered by the deep folds of his
hood. Her eyes locked with his. Tiny pinpoints of reflected light, were pointing straight at her, and her stomach
lurched. She took in a breath, bracing herself for the smell of wet human, but was greeted by an earthy, slightly sweet
aroma.

"Do you know of our order?" A voice leaked out from the thin lips.

"No", she said flatly and quickly turned away. She'd been caught staring, and this old man had clearly misinterpreted
her caution for interest.

"We are part of the church of evolution, of the order saturniidae" he said.

"Never heard of it", Andrea felt his eyes boring into her, and she feigned busying herself with something inside her
jacket.

"It's a very old one" he said, "but recently we've seen a growth in popularity". Without even a pause, he continued.
"Tell me. Do you feel incomplete. Like something is missing from your life? Like there's some part of you, not missing
per say, but that you feel is important? Like you're incomplete? It's fairly common in todays climate, with things being
as they are."

She could hear him fumbling with something in his pocket, and she dreaded the thought of having to receive anything from
this person, let alone some flier or info card. There was a ding, and she had never been so happy in all her life to
hear it. From the doors, a soft click sounded and the doors quietly rumbled open. Without even pausing to look, Andrea
stepped around the man, and practically leapt out of the enclosed space.

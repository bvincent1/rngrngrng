"Goddammit!" Andrea yelled.

This guy had pitched forward and was now unconscious. He lay there in the pouring rain, a wet and crumpled lump of
black. He was dead weight now. She couldn't carry him, and she certainly couldn't stay to interrogate him. Andrea looked
down at him, tempted to leave him in the road to get scooped up by the crew that almost killed them just now. She knew
he could still be useful. He had been there longer than her. He could know something that she could use. She bent over
to drag him somewhere safe. Safer. She chided herself. Grabbing an arm she dragged him into the nearest alleyway. It was
cramped and wet, and she bumped his head a few times. He groaned once and she thought he might wake up, but then he
stayed quiet. She let go of his arms, and stepped over him to check on the apartment. She couldn't make out much through
the rain, but she didn't see anyone on the balcony actively looking for them. This team of sweepers were probably more
professional than that. They were probably bagging everything and then getting out. Consummate professionals.

She was a professional, but somehow this lump of dead weight had gotten the best of her. She hated that. It made her
furious that she'd lost to this. That she'd almost been killed. Her thoughts and emotions swirled in her head until she
calmed enough to plan what to do next.

She walked back towards the strewn out body. His whole outfit looked like ex military, but all black and without any
insignias. She didn't recognize the make of any of it, but it was well worn and had clearly seen better days. Despite
the dark, but without his hood up, she could make out his face. He wasn't ugly or scared, and she could see his black
hair had grown out of a crewcut. Some similar black stubble had speckled his face in barely even clumps. He looked pale,
and she thought that maybe the fall had done a number on him. She checked him over, searching his pockets while she
went.

Only a phone. No gun, no tech, not even a knife. Nothing else. This idiot had broken in with nothing. She let out a
groan of her exasperation. After taking a moment, she noticed a small dark pool under one of his arms. She lifted the
arm and checked the wound. Just a scratch, not life threatening. She didn't even bother to make a bandage.

It just occurred to her that she might had been hit. She didn't actively feel anything, but she still did a quick pat
down of herself to check. Chest, arms, legs, ass. She was whole and, now that she'd had a chance to calm down, she was
thinking clearer. She had a plan, and she was going to make it work.

She repositioned his arms to his sides and left him momentarily in the alley. She walked towards the back, and carefully
peaked into the alley beyond. It was littered with trash, including a dented bin strewn across the center, but otherwise
is was empty. She walked out and started searching. She soon found some cardboard that, after shaking off the larger
chunks of slime, would make do. She dragged it back to the alley and found the man still unconscious, right where she'd
left him. She was somewhat surprised that she'd fared so much better than him, but unlike this guy, Andrea had seen the
wall coming at them and braced with her legs appropriately. She felt around in his pockets one more time, added a
present, and then pulled out her phone to confirm her it was working. Once she saw the pulsing icon, she pocketed her
phone and pulled the soaking cardboard over his sopping wet body. She then rolled him onto it and pulled the rest over
his crumpled form. She stood there, inspecting her handiwork. Confident that he'd live she turned and made for the back
alley.

She followed it towards the end of the block, careful not to make herself an easy target should anyone see her. She
checked the street beyond, and continued stealing between alleys for several blocks in the same, careful manner. Once
she'd decided this was enough, she found a tarpan to stand under, pulled out her phone, and tapped some icons to hail a
ride.

While she waited for her ride, she adjusted her look to be more presentable. She undid her scarf, which she'd been using
to cover her face, and wrung it out. She tried to towel her hair with it, fighting the futility of it all. Appearances
were important, she told herself. Never let them see you weak. Her dark hair looked better now, but she was still liable
to shoot anyone who made a comment. On that note, she undid her leg holster and tucked it into her jacket, making sure
it was concealed it in a pocket at her side. Local laws forbid open cary, but it wasn't exactly enforced to a consistent
degree. It was still common enough to see people armed with not only pistols like hers, but full on assault weapons out
in the street. The problem was that it tended to attract the kind of attention that she didn't want right now.

She draped her scarf over her head in a mock hood, and made sure it covered the bulkier straps of her gear harness. A
few minutes later, her ride pulled up and she got in. She locked eyes with the driver in the rear view mirror for a
second, and he quickly looked away. He didn't even wait for her to say anything, and just pulled away from the curb. She
took a moment to appreciate the warmth inside, before letting herself relax and leaning back into the seat. Lights
blurred past outside as they made there way out of this dense block, and onto the grid streets. The muffled rain, and
whine of the motors felt soothing to Andrea, and she let out a breath she hadn't known she had been holding. In the
distance she could see the lights of the city coming and going. They passed other vehicles, going towards different
blocks, and a feeling of worry slowly ate away at her calm. She imagined some crew coming to track her down, and
interrogate her. They'd be convinced she knew something, and she'd have to convince them that she was just as in the
dark as them. Maybe Emilia would send them. Maybe she'd choose to evaluate her, and make sure Andrea hadn't gone rogue.

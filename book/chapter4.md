> UNII Corps log date 2327-09-30-0232

"Goddammit!" Andrea yelled.

This guy had pitched forward and was now unconscious. He lay there in the pouring rain, a wet and crumpled lump of
black. He was dead weight now. She couldn't carry him, and she certainly couldn't stay to interrogate him. Andrea looked
down at him, tempted to leave him in the road to get scooped up by the crew that almost killed them just now. She knew
he could still be useful. He had been there longer than her. He could know something that she could use. She bent over
to drag him somewhere safe. Safer. She chided herself. Grabbing an arm she dragged him into the nearest alleyway. It was
cramped and wet, and she bumped his head a few times. He groaned once and she thought he might wake up, but then he
stayed quiet. She let go of his arms, and stepped over him to check on the apartment. She couldn't make out much through
the rain, but she didn't see anyone on the balcony actively looking for them. This team of sweepers were probably more
professional than that. They were probably bagging everything and then getting out. Consummate professionals.

She was a professional, but somehow this lump of dead weight had gotten the best of her. She hated that. It made her
furious that she'd lost to this. That she'd almost been killed. Her thoughts and emotions swirled in her head until she
calmed enough to plan what to do next.

She walked back towards the strewn out body. His whole outfit looked like ex military, but all black and without any
insignias. She didn't recognize the make of any of it, but it was well worn and had clearly seen better days. Despite
the dark, but without his hood up, she could make out his face. He wasn't ugly or scared, and she could see his black
hair had grown out of a crewcut. Some similar black stubble had speckled his face in barely even clumps. He looked pale,
and she thought that maybe the fall had done a number on him. She checked him over, searching his pockets while she
went.

Only a phone. No gun, no tech, not even a knife. Nothing else. This idiot had broken in with nothing. She let out a
groan of her exasperation. After taking a moment, she noticed a small dark pool under one of his arms. She lifted the
arm and checked the wound. Just a scratch, not life threatening. She didn't even bother to make a bandage.

It just occurred to her that she might had been hit. She didn't actively feel anything, but she still did a quick pat
down of herself to check. Chest, arms, legs, ass. She was whole and, now that she'd had a chance to calm down, she was
thinking clearer. She had a plan, and she was going to make it work.

She repositioned his arms to his sides and left him momentarily in the alley. She walked towards the back, and carefully
peaked into the alley beyond. It was littered with trash, including a dented bin strewn across the center, but otherwise
is was empty. She walked out and started searching. She soon found some cardboard that, after shaking off the larger
chunks of slime, would make do. She dragged it back to the alley and found the man still unconscious, right where she'd
left him. She was somewhat surprised that she'd fared so much better than him, but unlike this guy, Andrea had seen the
wall coming at them and braced with her legs appropriately. She felt around in his pockets one more time, added a
present, and then pulled out her phone to confirm her it was working. Once she saw the pulsing icon, she pocketed her
phone and pulled the soaking cardboard over his sopping wet body. She then rolled him onto it and pulled the rest over
his crumpled form. She stood there, inspecting her handiwork. Confident that he'd live she turned and made for the back
alley.

She followed it towards the end of the block, careful not to make herself an easy target should anyone see her. She
checked the street beyond, and continued stealing between alleys for several blocks in the same, careful manner. Once
she'd decided this was enough, she found a tarpan to stand under, pulled out her phone, and tapped some icons to hail a
ride.

While she waited for her ride, she adjusted her look to be more presentable. She undid her scarf, which she'd been using
to cover her face, and wrung it out. She tried to towel her hair with it, fighting the futility of it all. Appearances
were important, she told herself. Never let them see you weak. Her dark hair looked better now, but she was still liable
to shoot anyone who made a comment. On that note, she undid her leg holster and tucked it into her jacket, making sure
it was concealed it in a pocket at her side. Local laws forbid open cary, but it wasn't exactly enforced to a consistent
degree. It was still common enough to see people armed with not only pistols like hers, but full on assault weapons out
in the street. The problem was that it tended to attract the kind of attention that she didn't want right now.

She draped her scarf over her head in a mock hood, and made sure it covered the bulkier straps of her gear harness. A
few minutes later, her ride pulled up and she got in. She locked eyes with the driver in the rear view mirror for a
second, and he quickly looked away. He didn't even wait for her to say anything, and just pulled away from the curb. She
took a moment to appreciate the warmth inside, before letting herself relax and leaning back into the seat. Lights
blurred past outside as they made there way out of this dense blok, and onto the grid streets. The muffled rain, and
whine of the motors felt soothing to Andrea, and she let out a breath she hadn't known she had been holding. In the
distance she could see the lights of the city coming and going. They passed other vehicles, going towards different
bloks, and a feeling of worry slowly ate away at her calm. She imagined some crew coming to track her down, and
interrogate her. They'd be convinced she knew something, and she'd have to convince them that she was just as in the
dark as them. Maybe Emilia would send them. Maybe she'd choose to evaluate her, and make sure Andrea hadn't gone rogue.

Andrea had been at this all day. She had missed her check-in and she knew that would raise alarms. She felt like she had
enough **track** that she could pull it off, but maybe she was wrong. She constantly second guessed her relationships at
the office. Despite all that she'd done, and all that she'd accomplished, shed never fully trust the corporate world. Or
anyone, for that matter. Trusting people got you in trouble. Andrea couldn't afford trouble. Either way, she was sure
she'd get a call about the check-in. She'd have to spin something about following a lead. This Lili Kant had proven much
more competent than her file had lead on to. Andrea had spent the better part of her day tracking her across town, from
one place to the next only to get trounced by some amateur. There she went again, her fear of failure getting replaced
with her rage at disappointment.

How could this random have found out about this? How could he have known? Clearly there was a leak somewhere in
corporate, but what could Andrea even do. That wasn't her domain, her workplace. She was a field operative. A
professional in an industry of un-professional activities. She was busy introspecting her relations and revaluating
herself when the car pulled off the grid, and started towards her blok. The car announced that the grid had ended, with
a soft beep and the driver double checked the range on his battery. The math seemed to line up, since he didn't
immediately kick her out and kept driving.

The rain had eased up by the time she'd arrived at her destination. She got out, and with out so much as a nod the
driver took off. Her phone dinged, and funds were withdrawn from her account. She turned and walked up the steps to the
mega tower doors. A few steps later and she pushed open the heavy metal and glass doors into the interior. It was warmer
than outside, but not without rain curtesy of the open atrium ascending all the way up the building. She made her way to
the elevators, conscious of the pistol holster bumping into her side underneath her jacket. She made it to the elevator,
and punched in her floor number. She waited, hopping no one would get on. She watched as the metal doors inched closer
and closer together, and breathed a sign of relief.

"Hold up", a dry and raspy male voice said, before she saw an ugly, wrinkled hand jut between the doors. Andrea sucked
in a breath, and consciously acknowledge the pistol pocking into her side for reassurance. The metals doors opened and
she knew she'd just stumbled into a nightmare. A heavily shrouded figure, with thick flowing robes stepped into the
elevator. The voice was male, but she could barely make out any distinguishing features beside the hand, and the bottom
of the face.

"Could you pick floor 124 for me?" A voice creaked from the beneath the hood.

The voice sounded as old as the wrinkled hand suggest, and Andrea felt her heart flutter. That was her floor.

She immediately knew that today must be some sick joke the universe had decided to play on her. First she'd spent the
whole day chasing around bogus leads given to her by the incompetents in her office, only to get disarmed by some
amateur in thrifted gear, and finally almost killed by a hit squad with more firepower than subtlety. She could feel the
anger coursing through her veins, and her patience evaporated.

"Miss?" The voice rasped, a single wrinkled finger complete with jagged nail pointed to the elevator controls.

She made a token effort to select the floor, despite it clearly being highlighted and settled in the rear corner
opposite the veiled man. The elevator doors slowly began closing again, and she wondered if she should just get off and
wait for the next one. But the man would just be there anyways, so she resigned herself to her fate.

With a familiar jolt, the elevator accelerated up and she exhaled slightly, conscious of the breath she'd been holding
in. She took in a breath, bracing herself for the smell of wet human, but was greeted by an earthy, slightly sweet
aroma. Strange. Without trying to be overt, she tried to get a better look at the man, hoping he wouldn't notice her and
try to start a conversation. The first thing she'd noticed was that his robes weren't particularly ugly like him, but
well kept, and a deep red color that reminded her of insects. The robes were made of a thick gaged cloth, and covered
him almost completely. The hood obscured most of his his face, and pilled at his severely hunched neck and shoulder.
From there is was straight down to the floor the outfit dragged behind him. The whole look exasperated the insect
metaphor and did nothing to invite approachability. What she could see of the man, made her dread the sight of him in
any other outfit. She saw his hands were wrinkled, not so much as with age, but with loose skin. His nails were too
long, and lent a strong comparison to claws. Continuing her threat assessment, Andrea couldn't help but tilt her head up
slightly to try and get a look at his face. His long and pointed chin stuck out from his hood, followed by thin pale
lips, and a curved nose above them. She couldn't help but follow up the face trying to make out his eyes in the recesses
of his hood. Her eyes locked with his. Tiny pinpoints of reflected light, were pointing straight at her, and her stomach
lurched.

"Do you know of our order?" A voice leaked out from the thin lips. Sounding more like air escaping a rigored corpse than
an actual human being.

"No", she said flatly and quickly turned her head away. She'd been caught staring, and now she'd have to pay the price.

"I am are part of the church of evolution, of the order saturniidae" he said. "I'm acolyte Jacob."

"Never heard of it", Andrea chirped hoping to cut the man off and forestall any further conversation. Andrea felt his
eyes boring into her, and she feigned busying herself with something inside her jacket.

"It's a very old one" he said, "but recently we've seen a growth in popularity". Without even a pause, he continued.
"Tell me. Do you feel incomplete? Like something is missing from your life? Like there's some part of you, not missing
per say, but that you feel is important? Like you're incomplete? It's fairly common in todays climate, with things being
as they are."

She could hear him fumbling with something in his pocket, and she dreaded the thought of having to receive anything from
this person. There was a familiar, universal ding, and she had never been so happy in all her life to hear it. From the
doors, a soft click sounded and the doors quietly rumbled open. Without even pausing to look at the man, Andrea stepped
around him, and practically leapt out of the enclosed space.

Andrea was so distracted trying to ignore the acolyte, that she didn't look up until it was almost too late. She had
almost collided with someone waiting at the top of the elevator, and had to quickly throw herself back to arrest her
momentum. She let out a small **scream**, and the pedestrian threw up an arm to ward off some unknown attacker. Andrea
cursed herself for this, and when she caught her balance again, she tried to duck around the flailing person, only to
find herself face to face with a group of acolytes. She stopped and stood there, dumbstruck by the sight. Slowly the
horror rose through her body as she dreaded yet more pointless conversations of saviors and completeness.

The hooded faces all snapped to look her dead in eyes, and she was stunned by the speed and ferocity of the motion. It
was some sort of hivemind they or group mentality they must have used to track her and descend onto her in a vain
attempt at committing yet another sinful member of the public to their religious order. Andrea felt herself freeze under
their intense gaze, unsure how to proceed. She desperately wanted to pull her gun, unloaded as it was, and brandish it
in front of herself to get these bipedal insectoids out of her way and just get home. She was halfway through reaching
into her pocket when the person she'd almost ran over turned to face her and spoke.

"I'm so sorry, I should really get out of the way." He said, **adopting** a jovial and well meaning tone.

She stopped to look at the man addressing her and saw to her continued horror that he was wearing a black suit with a
priests collar. Instead of the aged beetle of a human the acolyte had been, this man was middle aged, and very well
kept. He had clean cut hair, jet black, was cleanly shaved, and was tall and upright.

"My bad, I just need to get home" she hurriedly said, slowly stepping away.

"Of course, it's been a busy night for all of us and I'm sure you're no exception." He said, but made no effort to move,
or direct the others. "Oh, I see you've met acolyte Jacob. Did he tell you anything about us? Our mission and purpose
perhaps?"

Andrea nodded in the affirmative, keeping her eyes on the well dressed man, but distinctly aware of a large number of
paired pin sized reflections tracking her from behind him. She took a smaller step back, and feigned adjusting her
jacket while slowly reaching for her sidearm.

"He probably didn't do it justice, allow me introduce myself," he paused "I am reverend Desmond Smithson."

He held out a hand, and Andrea narrowed her eyes at him.

"Pay no mind to the acolytes." He said, deftly turning his failed negotiation into a sweeping gesture. "They're just
here to help me find someone. We seem to have lost them in this maze of a building."

Andrea's fingers were brushing up against the handle of her pistol. Even with the holster jammed between her arm and
side, she knew she could make a smooth pull if they tried anything. She was tense. There were a lot of them, more than
she could handle even if she had ammunition.

Playing back what the reverend had said, something clicked. She inadvertently cocked her head, mulling it over.

"Have you seen someone wandering around? They'd stand out of course. Talking nonsense about who knows what." reverend
Desmond said, pressing her for an answer.

"Does this missing person have a name?" Andrea finally answered. She had the pistol firmly grasped now, and didn't care
that it was obvious. The revered seemed more interested than afraid, clearly willing to ignore her obvious threat, in
favor of pumping her for information. Well two could play this game, she thought. She wanted to find out what this cult
was really after. "Or are you just snatching up desperate candidates for your cult?" she quickly added, her temper
flaring again.

"I assure you, all our members are willing participants. You can't force religion on people. They never take it to heart
that way. Our flock is open to skeptics and curious alike" reverend Desmond continued. "We've cultivated a culture of
openness and growth that rivals all the other institutions. It's not a competition, but I'd wager we'd win in that
respect." he gloated

"I'm sure" Andrea was getting tired of this. She had barely held it together for the single acolyte, let alone this
group and their charismatic reverend. She took a bigger step back this time, and the group behind reverend Desmond
fanned out, faster than she would've thought possible for anyone of that rigor. The sudden inhuman skittering fanout,
made her heart jump, and she reflexively pulled her gun to bear on the reverend.

One hand on her gun, the other at her side, she felt quite the statement. To her surprise the man didn't so much as
flinch. Something was off. She could feel the hairs on her neck rising, and a sinking feeling rose from her stomach to
her heart. Somehow she'd wandered into something much more dangerous than she could've predicted.

"I assure you, that isn't necessary. We were just about leave anyways." The reverend calmly said, ice in his voice.

The warm conversation had now frozen over. His true self had become visible for only a moment, but it chilled Andrea all
the same. The ice in his voice, and the chill in his body language had been enough. The reverend tapped his leg twice,
and the hodden figures relented their boring stairs. Andrea saw them turn in unison away from her and make for the
hallways leading out towards the apartment units on this floor.

"I don't know his name, but he is dangerous." Reverend Desmond said, the chill still in his voice. He was fishing
something out from his pocket. "If you do see someone who doesn't belong, let us know. It'll be better for everyone", he
held up a business card, in front of his face and dramatically let it fall to the ground. Without another word, he
turned away and followed one of the acolytes in the opposite direct from her.

She stood there, dumbfounded, gun raised at nothing. Her brain had trouble making sense of it all. She let her arm fall
to her side, still clutching the gun. She took a deep breath and reset herself. This was not the time to be soft.
Centering herself, she turned and headed towards her unit. She kept her gun lowered, refusing to get caught up in
anything else today.

She traveled the winding hallways towards her unit. She checked the corners along the way, wary of any more church
members who might be laying in wait. The cold concrete walls and floors combined with the colder LED lights did nothing
to assay her fears. Passing steel doors at a quickening pace, she felt every shadow watch her, unseen eyes tracking her
movements. Once she thought she saw a pair of pinpoint reflections, like those of underneath the hoods of the acolytes.
She herd a click, and felt a cold breeze on her neck. She broke into a slow trot, and then a run. All this time and she
had yet to see a single other tenant. Nobody is the halls. Even the temperature had dropped, the perpetual warmth of
tightly packed bodies had been transformed into a cold unfeeling vacuum.

At the last corner Andrea fumbled her free hand awkwardly across her body to get her keycard out. She kept her gun
leveled down the hall, as she coordinated her feet forwards, and her hand inside her pocket. She got to her door, an
cold identical steel with only her unit number as it's defining feature. She slapped the reader next to it with her card
and it registered on the first try. A faint tick, and she used her gun hand to pull the handle down and shove the door
open.

She slid across the door, rather than open it all the way, and quickly, but quietly, closed it. She dropped her gun, and
made for her holdout stash. Her kitchen light was on, and illuminated the empty room. She ran headlong across her living
room to the door to her office. Careening off the doorframe at an oblique angle and stumbling towards the closet at the
end of the room. She only bothered with one of the double doors and reached inside the dark shelving to grasp a handle
that she knew would be there. Her hand grasped empty air, and she audibly cursed. She abandoned fumbling in the dark,
and turned to wall switch. Her movement turned her enough that she dared to peak at the doorway she'd burst through
moments ago. She couldn't explain why she was so scared. Something about her day had pushed her to the breaking point.
Maybe it was everything combined, followed up by this whole ordeal with the cult that had her so off balance.

She turned to inspect the doorway, and for a moment there was an outline she couldn't explain. A split second later her
hand found the light switch and light flooded the closet, **shying** the shape away. Andrea whipped her head back around
and saw the shotgun handle inches from where she had grasped for it. She cursed herself again, grabbed the handle and
pulled it out while spinning around as fast as she dared. Her spin brought her face to face with nothing. She leveled
the gun with her other hand, and racked the slide. It made a satisfying _chunk_ noise, and she immediately felt better.

She stood there, gun leveled at the doorway leading back into her living room. The closet light spilled out from behind
her, half blocked by the sliding door on the opposite side, and illuminated her desk. She swept the gun away from the
door and towards her desk, eying the chair that faced away from her. She took a single step towards it. She turned the
gun back towards the doorway, contemplating the absurdity of her whole situation.

Abandoning caution, she covered the three steps to the chair and kicked it from behind into the desk. She judged by the
give that it was empty, and the noise of the crash meant that there was nothing under the desk. Turning towards the
door, she closed the gap to the wall and then took a single step away and leveled the gun at chest height. She paused
for a split second, took a deep breath, and then smoothly stepped out from her office.

She leveled the gun at her front door, expecting it to be magically open with one of those insectoid people framed in
the doorway. The door was not open, and she turned to her bedroom, refusing to let her fears go just yet. Something at
the back of her mind wouldn't let it go. Ignoring yet again the absurdity of it all, she walked across her living room,
gun raised, stepping onto and then over her couch. She covered the distance in less than four steps and set up next to
the doorway. Just like she had just done, she swept into the room checking each corner, and then settling on the
bathroom door. It was closed, which she assumed was how she'd left it, but she couldn't be sure. She reached for the
handle with her free hand and grabbed it. She counted down in her head, and at the bottom of the count swung the door.
She waited a heartbeat, and then spun through the opening, repeating her sweep across the tiny room. It was empty, but
she flicked the light on just to be sure. She was momentarily blinded before her eyes adjusted and she saw to her
satisfaction that the room ws empty, and that everything was how she had left it.

She let out a breath she'd forgotten to release on her way into the room and relaxed. She lowered her shotgun and
stepped towards her bathroom mirror. She wanted to get a good look at herself. Maybe she'd have some visible chunk of
her skull missing to explain this insane behavior she was exhibiting. She stood there, taking it all in. She was whole,
no cuts, no bleeding from her head. Her black hair was had loosened from the bun she'd tied and her eyes were bloodshot
and had dark circles under them. She tried to focus on the bags but felt dizzy all of a sudden and she thought she
imagined the reflection turning to static. She forced herself to focus, ignoring the dizziness and her image returned to
normal. She let out a sigh, looked down at her gun and thumbed the safety. She unloaded the round she'd chambered
earlier, and inserted it back into the magazine. She checked it over, before slinging it across her arms, and walking
back into her living room. She took stock of the mess she'd made, paying careful attention to the prints her boots had
left on her floor, and in her couch material. She thought about putting the gun away, but decided against it just yet.
She walked towards her front door and untied her boots. Flipping them off, and retrieving her discarded pistol and
holster. She tucked it back into the holster and left it on her kitchen counter. She emptied her pockets into the
receptacle next to the door and removed her soaking jacket and scarf. Andrea forwent turning on more lights, favoring
the kitchen light and it's warmth over the cold clinical overhead lighting. She made her way to her kitchen cupboard,
keeping the shotgun slung in her offhand. She reached up to her cupboard and revealed the contents. Inside was a pair of
tumblers and a bottle of whisky. With a practiced hand she nimbly held the glass and bottle together and lowered them to
the counter.

"I'm treating myself today, tomorrow I'll have to deal with the office" she said to herself.

She unscrewed the cap and poured a pair of fingers worth into the glass. She left returned the cap, and reached for the
freezer door. She pulled out her ice tray and awkwardly cracked a pair of icecubes loose while handling her gun. She
continued her awkward jamble and dropped the pair of icecubes into the drink with a satisfying clank-crack. She returned
her ice to freezer, and ignored the stray flakes of of on her counter. Fixed drink in hand, she walked to her couch and
let herself collapse into it.

She let the gun lean against the cushion next to her and tilted her head back. Despite having her back to the door, she
took comfort in the solemnity she commanded from her throne. she tilted her head back up and took a sip, savouring the
rich and peaty flavor. Small droplets of rain pattered on her window and Andrea looked out her window, taking in the
view. City lights offered dim illumination far bellow her. Their dull **illumnations** constant sources of energy and
life in the otherwise all consuming lifeless city. Their were no cars, and no trains, just the deep pause before the
city woke up from it's fitful slumber. Far away steam rose from smaller towers, fading quietly into the wet night air.
Andrea often looked out her windows and lost herself in the magnitude of it all. She thought back to all the battles
she'd fought here and how little it meant to the great machine. With or without her, it would toil onwards. The city
consumed everything. It pulled everything towards it, consuming it and repurposing it for itself. Everyone here was at
the mercy of it. Some great monster they all paid homage to, each one hopping to stave off being it's next meal for a
moment longer. The bigger it got, the greater its pull, and the greater the toll it exacted on it's **patrons**.

"Uhhhhgggggg" andrea let out a great sign.

This pondering was taking a toll on her and she felt a wave of exhaustion washing over her. She took another sip from
her glass, and leaned back again closing her eyes this time. She did not open them for a while.

...

Andrea felt weightless for a second. Not like the classic fitful jerk that would've startled her awake, but a slow sense
of existing in a space that had no gravity. She felt free here, her limbs floated freely and her mind didn't have the
usual hum of constant worries and problems. It was blissful. She wanted to stay there forever. Slowly, the feeling
faded, and she felt the abrasive cushion she had rested her head on. Her neck ached, and she realized she must have
fallen asleep. She slowly opened her eyes, weary of any blinding sunlight. To her surprise there was none. She carefully
sat up and looked around herself, dreading having to clean up even more mess, or even accidentally setting off the
shotgun. She saw her drink was intact, just inches from her hand. Her gun was still leaning up, just outside her reach
in this position. She grabbed her half finished drink, and felt the glass as room temperature. Her heart sank a degree
at the wasted spirit. Lifting the glass to her mouth, she paused. She was looking out, expecting to see the city, or
even the light of a peeking sun on the horizon. It was pitch black out. Andrea felt confused. She'd never seen the sky
so dark, or even the city.

"Powers out?", she asked herself. But her kitchen light was still on, so it must be everywhere else? That didn't make
any sense. She stood up and walked over to the window, drink still in hand. She stood at her window looking out, and
what she saw made no sense. It was an inky void, swirling and moving like some black sheet rippling in the wind. Except
it wasn't a sheet, and it engulfed the whole building. Andrea pressed her face against the glass, peering down as far as
she could. She couldn't see anything below her, not even other lights from her building. Just empty.

She pulled away, unsure what to do. She went to grab her phone, check for strange weather notifications, or something on
the socials. She turned away to grab it when she was speared by a great beam of light. She turned back to the window,
her heart pounding and her mind frozen in panic. There it was. A hole in the great sheet that engulfed everything. In
the hole she saw a swirling light, deep inside the inky black. It was pulsing, and she fer her skin start to crawl. The
light was all she could see, and it made her eyes water, but she couldn't turn away. Fear froze her in place, and her
brain refused to respond to her baser instincts like "run", "hide", or "do anything but stand here". She was struck with
the inability to resist it. She could almost hear it, a buzzing just outside the glass.

"Ahh", she let out a half strangled scream and jolted awake. Her hand immediately knocked her drink onto her couch, and
she groggily cursed herself.

"Fuck me!", she yelled for real this time. The sky had returned to it grungy steam filled state and she willed herself
into coherence. She stood to get something to sop up the mess, but she swayed, steadied herself, and forced herself into
a capable state. She turned and looked up to her kitchen. This time she didn't scream.

There was a figure. It was human, but covered in a cloak made from a torn piece of tarp. The figure had the hood drawn,
covering their face, but Andrea could tell it was a man. He stood motionless, frozen just like her. For a second she
thought it was one of those freaks from earlier, but this was different. Underneath his tarp he wore rags and was
covered in mud. He was hunched but not from age. She had locked eyes with him, and he had locked eyes with her. His eyes
weren't pins of pale reflections, but dull and almost half out of focus. He was looking directly at her, but she felt he
was somehow looking past her.

She took a half breath, careful not to break eye contact.

"Don't", the mans said, steadily.

It was too late. Andrea had half dove, half crouched to the gun resting on the couch. The barrel was already pointing in
roughly the right direction, she just had to flip it over, thumb the safety, pump the handle, and pull the trigger. It
was a lot of things to do in series, and a less experienced person would've fucked it up. She was better than that. In
one smooth motion she did all that, and a deafening _boom_ erupted from the barrel. She caught the intruder across the
face, putting a huge tear in his tarp, and scoring a direct hit across the side of his head. The wall behind him
exploded, and dust washed down onto him. Ears ringing, Andrea racked the slide again, and raised the gun to her
shoulder. The dust obscured her view, but she could see he was still standing. Rather than blindly pump another round
she waited for the dust to clear, figuring his body had yet to fully recognize it's own death. The dust slowly ceded,
and Andrea saw the wound she had made. Hood decimated, she saw his head had split open, revealing the obliterated gore
inside. His skin was pale, practically grey, and she could see that she caved in half his head from eye to jaw. He stood
there, motionless. He hadn't moved except to tell her not to kill him. She took a step closer. He didn't collapse, and
he didn't bleed all over her floor. She took another step closer, her gun almost touching the man. His eye, the only one
left, tracked her and she went to pull the trigger again, but his hand jerked up and grabbed the barrel. A jolt went
through the gun and she yelped, involuntarily letting go of it.

"Don't", the man said, wearily this time, clearly exhausted.

"You're dead, you're fucking dead!" Andrea yelled, stepping back even further. She was almost at her breaking point.
This day, or maybe just this week, had been enough.

He turned his head to look at her, and seemed to notice the gun in his hand. He looked like he'd only just noticed it,
and was debating using it on her. After a brief pause, he looked up and discarded the gun behind him, much to her
surprise. She looked down at his feet, feeling the hopelessness sink in. She'd just pumped a round into this mans head,
and he had basically shrugged it off. Her knees felt wobbly, and she had to fight to keep from collapsing on the floor.
She looked up, unsure what to expect next. Her jaw opened halfway, and she felt even more hopeless than she had a second
ago.

The hole she'd punched in his head was healing. She watched in horror as the collapsed skull and tissue unwound itself
from the interior of his skull. She saw gore twist and unwind, filling gaps that had been carved out by her. Bone
slithered out from inside his skull, and she heard cracks as the pieces socketed themselves back into place. Finally,
she watched as the skin at the edges of the wound spark and multiply. It wasn't regrowing, it was rematerializing on his
face slowly but surely.

"Need your help" he said, shying away from her.

She had a hard time understanding that a man who could rebuild his own skull after receiving a mortal wound would be shy
about it, but she understood the look he'd given her. She wasn't sure what to do. Her expertise had stopped the moment
she'd gotten home it seemed.

"How about you get the", she stopped halfway through and paused for a heartbeat. This man was clearly capable, and maybe
even dangerous. He ws probably some escaped experiment, or like those religious freaks. It snapped together. That suit
leading those freaks had mentioned they were looking for someone. It had to be this guy. Her brain rapid fired through
several different scenarios, desperately trying to find ways to turn this to her advantage.

"wwwwhat do you need me for? Clearly you're more than capable on your own", she stalled.

His head jerked back towards her, and she saw the wound was almost completely healed.

"Not important, we need to move", he said. That same distant look again. "It's important that we find him, he's the key
to solving this."

"Who? What?" Andrea asked, still stalling. "Slow down, how about we start with your name. I'm Andrea.", she gestured to
herself with both hands, and then reversed the gesture towards the man. "And you are??"

"I'm... I'm Alva... I'm Hector", he said, the words spilling out him half formed. "I am Hector, and I need to find him.
We need to find him. You can trust me. I can help you."

That was strange, she had been halfway to saying the same thing to this Hector guy.

"I can't help you. You can trust me though", He said.

That was getting creepy. Was Hector somehow reading her thoughts? Andrea couldn't keep up with him and plan her win out
of this mess. "How are you doing that?" she asked, trying for a different tactic. "How are you healing yourself? Are you
involved with that church?"

"No" he responded.

"They were looking for you, you know", she continued. "Are you sure you're not supposed to be with them?"

"I don't need them yet, first..." He paused, and turned his head to look out her window. "No I haven't told him, he's
too..." Hector snapped his head back towards her. "Look Andrea, I need you to trust me. I don't have much time. You need
to take me to him. The man you found earlier today."

Andrea startled slightly. Suddenly Hector had a drastically different personality. His voice still sounded the same, but
now he was speaking with a fervor that hadn't been there a second ago.

"I know you can find him. Take me too him, and I'll help you get what you want", Hector continued. "I know you can find
him."

"Ok, who do you think I can find?", Andrea asked. Just then she heard her phone beep. Hector turned away, and she
watched him walk towards her door. He stopped in front, and stood there in his motionless pose.

Without taking her eyes off Hector, Andrea fished her phone out of her pocket. There was a business card stuck to the
rear of it. Andrea twisted her hand around, puzzled. Her blood ran cold as she slowly read the title in bold serif font.

> Church of Evolution

Her blood ran cold. She had no clue how that had gotten there. Her phone buzzed again, imploring her to check on it. She
twisted her hand back and held her phone level with Hector and tapped the screen to check her notifications. She saw
that her tracker had activated, and that it was on the move. Her brain cycled several ideas at once, but the most
important one came last. That idea was her solution to all this mess.

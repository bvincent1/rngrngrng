"Goddammit!" Andrea yelled.

This guy had pitched forward and was now unconscious. He lay there in the pouring rain, a wet and crumpled lump of
black. He was dead weight now. She couldn't carry him, and she certainly couldn't stay to interrogate him. Andrea looked
down at him, tempted to leave him in the road to get scooped up by the crew that almost killed them just now. She knew
he could still be useful, he had been there longer than her, and so she bent over to drag him somewhere safe. Safer. She
reminded herself. Grabbing an arm she dragged him into the nearest alleyway. It was cramped and wet, and she bumped his
head a few times. He groaned once and she thought he might wake up, but then he stayed quiet. She dropped his arms, and
stepped over him to check on the apartment. She couldn't make out much through the rain, but she didn't see anyone on
the balcony actively looking for them. This team of sweepers were probably more professional than that. They were
probably bagging everything and then getting out. Professionals.

She was a professional, but somehow this lump had gotten the best of her. She hated that. The hate kept her warm and
fueled her thoughts about what to do next. She walked back towards the strewn out body. In the dark she could make his
basic features now that his hood wasn't obscuring his face. He wasn't tall, or short, and his black hair had grown out
of a crewcut. Some similar stubble had speckled his face in barely even clumps. He was pale, either from the lighting or
just naturally. His whole outfit looked like ex military, but all black and without any insignias. She didn't recognize
any of it, but considering the shape it was in, it was probably surplus. She checked his gear and found only a phone. No
gun, nothing else. This idiot had broken in with nothing. She let out an her exasperation. She noticed a dark pool under
one of his arms, and saw he'd been shot at some point. She checked the wound and saw it wasn't life threatening.

It hadn't even occurred to her that she might had been hit. She didn't feel anything, but she still did a quick once
over to confirm. She was whole, and now that she'd had a chance to calm down, she was thinking clearer. She had a plan,
and she was going to get back on track.

She repositioned his arms to his sides and left him in the alley. He wasn't going anywheres yet, and she needed him
alive. She walked towards the rear and peaking into the alley beyond. It was littered with trash, including a dented bin
strewn across the center, but otherwise is was empty. She started searching and soon found some cardboard that looked
appropriate for her needs. She dragged it bag to the alley, and found him still unconscious right where she'd left him.
Looking back, she was somewhat surprised that she'd fared better, but unlike this guy, Andrea had foreseen the wall
coming at them and braced with her legs appropriately. She felt around in his pockets one more time and then pulled out
her phone to confirm her present was working. Once she saw the pulsing icon, she pocketed her phone and pulled the
soaking cardboard over his sopping wet body. She then rolled him onto it and pulled the rest over his crumpled form. She
stood and inspected her handiwork. Confident that he'd live she turned and make for the rear.

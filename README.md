## Synopsis

A new war is brewing and Arthur Caspar has unintentionally landed right in the middle of it. A mysterious new force is
threatening the entrenched megacorps, and now all sides are struggling to harness it for their own goals of total
control. Old technologies are waking up, and new threats are emerging faster than either side can deal with. Arthur and
his company of unlikely allies must shed their differences if they are to survive the web of corporate armies and the
god-like forces that seem to answer to one man.

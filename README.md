## Synopsis

A new war is brewing and Arthur “Del” O’Delt has unintentionally landed right in the middle of it. A mysterious new
power is rising, one strong enough to threaten the entrenched megacorps that rule everything in their shadow. Now, every
side is scrambling to seize it, each driven by the same hunger: total domination. Old threats are waking up, new ones
are emerging—faster than anyone can stop them, and now Del, alongside a company of unlikely allies, must confront their
differences to survive. Corporate armies are on the move. Cosmic, god-like powers are closing in. All of them racing to
control the one man who could mean the difference between survival and absolute destruction.

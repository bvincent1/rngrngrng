## Synopsis

A new war is brewing and the youngest survivor of a legendary mercenary group, Arthur “Del” O’Delt, has unintentionally
landed right in the middle of it. A mysterious new power is rising, one strong enough to threaten the entrenched
megacorps that rule everything in their shadow. Now, every side is scrambling to seize it, each driven by the same
hunger, total domination. Alongside the corporations, older threats are waking up, emerging faster than anyone can stop
them, and now Del, alongside a team of unlikely allies, must confront their differences to survive it all. Corporate
armies are on the move. Ancient man made horrors are closing in. All of them racing to control the one man who could
mean the difference between survival and total destruction.
